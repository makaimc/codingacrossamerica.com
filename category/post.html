            <p>I have never been to Nashville before, so image I have in my head of what it's
like is a gross generalization of what I am sure it actually is. I mainly
envision country music, a South/Midwestern sort of pride by the people that
reside there, and very little focus on new technology. I am probably wrong
about those three ...

the embedded Google Map on the about page). These modifications are due to

months on the road. Some types of days are more conducive than others

            <p>I'm writing this post from Kansas City, Missouri. One of the
things I find so striking here is how quiet it is downtown during the day
on weekends. Part of the lack of people may be due to the 100+ degree
weather, but my friend PJ who lives here says this is normal.</p>
