      <p>How do people facing life-altering health care decisions make the right
choices for their treatment? People turn to family, friends, and the web
to obtain advice outside of the doctor's office. However, information
available through these channels often creates more questions than answers.</p>
<p>In 2007, Shub Debgupta and his wife faced a nightmare scenario
during the pregancy of their first child. They were told their child could
be born with significant learning difficulties. Shub and his
wife asked themselves questions they could not find answers to, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How did other people handle their situation?</li>
<li>What would doctors, themselves faced with such a situation, choose to do?</li>
<li>How should they weight myriad factors important to their decision?</li>
</ul>
<p>Shub and his wife were fortunate. Their child was born healthy, without the
complications they feared. Yet this agnonizing experience stuck with Shub. In
early 2008, he founded <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wisertogether.com/">WiserTogether</a>
to improve health care decision making for patients.</p>
<img alt="WiserTogether's logo at their offices in Georgetown, Washington, DC" src="../img/130227-wisertogether/wisertogether-logo.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Shub's vision created a &quot;learn, compare, connect, then decide&quot; process
aided by actual patient data collected continuously since the company's
foundeding five years ago.</p>
<p>The process and data combine as the platform
<a class="reference external" href="https://mywiserhealth.com/">WiserHealth</a>. WiserHealth is a suite of
products for patients with varying situations, including pregnancy, arthritis,
heart problems, depression, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. The products
are sold to organizations that offer one or more of WiserHealth's services
to its employees.</p>
<div class="section" id="wiserhealth-development-in-washington-dc">
<h2>WiserHealth Development in Washington, DC</h2>
<p>WiserTogether's main office is in Georgetown, Washington, DC, just off
the classic M Street drag. Some employees also work remotely across the
United States in California and Georgia.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://goo.gl/maps/sNcMm"><img alt="WiserTogether's main office location" src="../img/130227-wisertogether/wisertogether-georgetown-office-location.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I met with several members of WiserTogether's development team, including
their Chief Technology Officer <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/easel">Erik LaBianca</a>.
WiserTogether uses a range of current technologies including
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>,
and a combination of client-side HyperText Markup Language (HTML),
JavaScript, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to deliver the WiserHealth
platform.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The team currently releases software updates two to three times a week and
is moving towards daily updates. Eventually they hope to have a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery">continuous delivery</a>
model in place for continuous updates certified with an extensive
automated testing suite before being released to the public.</p>

<p>Lunch at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thunderburger.com/index1.html">Thunderburger</a> with
several members of WiserTogether's development team. From left to right, Erik,
Kamalesh, Johnny, Jimmy, and Tareque.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>One of the topics we discussed was how software development is impacted by
being located in Washington, DC. Several development team members commented
that the technology meetup scene far surpasses some other
cities they've worked in. Washington, DC has well established
groups such as <a class="reference external" href="http://dcpython.org/">DC Python</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.django-district.org/">Django District</a> that attract
fifty-plus developers to monthly meetups.</p>
<p>However, a major disadvantage to working in software development in the
District is the shadow of the Federal government. Government agencies and
the military throw large sums of money around to &quot;solve&quot; problems.
Investments are not ramped up gradually based on project success but
are dumped all at once within a single fiscal year. This approach is
a complete mismatch with how to develop quality software. Instead, a
small software project using limited resources should prove that a
real problem is being solved.  Only then, if the solution proves
successful based on user feedback, should funding gradually increase to
build expanded features.</p>
<p>Two additional major issues arise from the amount of money that
is invested in large software projects for federal agencies. First, these
projects drain the local talent pool and increase developer salaries for
competing non-government technology companies. Second, the excessive
money leads to complicated, overengineered systems with vast arrays of
features that are wasted.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-can-government-do-to-help">
<h2>What Can Government Do To Help?</h2>
<p>How can federal and state governments help companies like
WiserTogether so they can improve the health care quality in the United
States? Our discussion coalesced around three aspects where government
must improve:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clarify <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a> laws by making regulations testable</li>
<li>Explicitly declare platforms that are pre-audited and approved</li>
<li>Create an open
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) ontology
application programming interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarifying HIPAA was a central theme during our discussion. The laws are
so convoluted that no one except lawyers can interpret the regulations.
Audits by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a>
(DHHS) are a nightmare. Fortunately, WiserTogether has not been been audited
directly by DHHS, but other organizations they work with have been.
Auditors are looking for a reason to &quot;prove&quot; their own worth by finding
fault with something. This is a broken system that both prevents innovative
companies from complying with the law (because no one can interpret it
properly) and creates a powerful disincentive to not start a company that
has to comply with these regulations.</p>
<p>Another issue is the need to clarify which platforms are
HIPAA-compliant for audit purposes. For example, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> platform-as-a-service could provide
a great foundation for health care applications. Unfortunately, no one knows
whether Heroku would pass an audit by Department of Health and Human Services.
Heroku is not a niche service - it is owned by Salesforce and runs millions
of applications for thousands of companies around the world.</p>
<p>Erik and his team also recommended that the National
Institute of Health should create an open ontology open application
programming interface (API). Companies in the healthcare industry could use
the API to organize data in their applications.</p>
<p>I am certainly no expert in the health care industry and I could be wrong
about the above points. If I am, please email me at
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:matthew.makai&#64;gmail.com">matthew.makai&#64;gmail.com</a> so I can correct my misinterpretations.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-s-next">
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>On March 9, I will head out to Charlottesville, Virginia and begin my tour
of 30 cities across the United States. I may meet with and write about one
or two more companies in DC before heading out if I can fit it into next
week's schedule.</p>
