    <h1>My Thoughts At One Month In</h1>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
      <p>
        <p>I have been on the road for one month today. Twenty percent of my time and
cities are behind me. I have driven just over 2600 miles according to my
aggregated daily mileage totals. Now is a good time to jot down my initial
thoughts and paint some broad themes from what I've seen firsthand.</p>
<p>But first, I am often asked &quot;what's been your favorite part of your trip?&quot;
I can't pick one specific high. In no particular order, my New Orleans
favorite was working with the
<a class="reference external" href="noew-ideacorps-pitch-challenge.html">MBA teams</a> at
New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week, as well as and hanging around the
<a class="reference external" href="http://ideavillage.org/">IdeaVillage</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://4pt0.org/">4.0 Schools</a> spaces. My Memphis favorite was spending
my first time in the city going out to dinner and drinks with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.seedhatchery.com/">Seed Hatchery</a>. Speaking to a great group
at <a class="reference external" href="http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html">MemPy</a> and talking to
<a class="reference external" href="https://workforpie.com/">Work for Pie</a> is up there as well.
Austin was just beyond any expectations for what I was hoping for. I loved
every minute I was in that city.</p>
<p>The biggest low so far was driving out of Austin on Sunday afternoon. That
was a difficult day. But I made it to Lubbock and now I've had some time
to reflect on my previous six cities.</p>
<p>Here are three themes consistenly appearing so far:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Startup communities are generous and open</li>
<li>Intercity connections are ad hoc and arbitrary</li>
<li>Startup entrepreneurship is a long way from being a &quot;normal&quot; thing to do</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="startup-community-generosity">
<h2>Startup Community Generosity</h2>
<p>The startup communities for most of my destinations, particularly New Orleans,
Memphis, Dallas, and Austin, have been very generous and open about their
cities. I'm amazed by the amount of time startups, accelerators, incubators,
co-working spaces, and independent developers have been willing to spend with
me to explain not only their own ventures but their cities in general.
Everyone has also been extremely forthcoming about what weaknesses they
perceive in their respective locations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intercity-connections">
<h2>Intercity Connections</h2>
<p>Connections between entrepreneurs and software developers between cities
are ad hoc and arbitrary. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge sharing
that could benefit entrepreneurs and developers that is not currently taking
place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entrepreneurship-normalcy">
<h2>Entrepreneurship Normalcy</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurship, even in the technology industry, is a long way from being
the &quot;normal&quot; thing to do. We have a long uphill climb before a majority of
software developers start their own companies or join early stage ventures.</p>
