<h1>Why Does Building Software for the Government Cost So Much?</h1>

      <p>The latest US government software project under the news media spotlight is
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">healthcare.gov</a> website. The
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/24/how-much-did-healthcare-gov-cost/">at least $350 million</a>&quot;
project has let few visitors complete the sign up process. When the
sign up process actually is successful, the

covered how technical issues turned into political difficulties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in history, a president has had to stand in the Rose
Garden to apologize for a broken Web site. But HealthCare.gov is only the
latest episode in a string of information technology debacles by the
federal government.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Despite the current issues with healthcare.gov, at least the website
launched on time. The same cannot be said for many expensive
government projects, such as the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701485.html">FBI's Virtual Case Management System</a>.</p>
<p>Why are these high profile failures and massive cost overruns so common in
government software development projects? This is a list of the most
significant issues that arise on these projects from my personal experience
in software development across several government agencies

and commercial and non-profit organizations

<div class="section" id="those-holding-the-purse-strings-are-not-users">
<h2>Those Holding the Purse Strings Are Not Users</h2>
<p>The government has a formal title for the guy who's in charge of the contract
and related financial decisions: Contracting Officer Representative (COR).
The COR is generally not an actual user. In a worst case scenario there are
multiple owners, none of whom will actually use the software, and everyone
has to put their stamp on every decision. Non-users are inclined to approve
flashy features and functionality that have no mission value but look good
during a demo.</p>
<p>There needs to be a better way to determine what value is provided to actual
users. However, even in this case there are often problems. Many end users do
not want a new software system. They sometimes do not want to retrain on a
new system or are concerned that their jobs will be replaced once the new
system is up and running.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-money-is-needed-to-justify-every-choice">
<h2>Time (Money) Is Needed to Justify Every Choice</h2>
<p>Justifying the use of common software libraries can often take multiple
weeks over periods of several months. Software developers are often asked
to create lengthy white papers and extensive documentation for simple code
reuse scenarios. Often this culture discourages software developers from
reusing proven, tested code because it would take longer to justify their
choice of library, than to rewrite the code from scratch.</p>
<p>In addition, the developer is accepts responsibility that if there are any
future issues with that reused code, justified or not, she is to blame.
Essentially the development process takes much longer than expected so that
everyone can cover their ass with documentation in case of failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="budget-process">
<h2>Budget Process</h2>
<p>All budget must be requested up front, often in multi-year estimates. The
software development estimation process is impossible on such long time
scales. Projects literally set themselves up for failure and inaccurate
budgets before they even begin.</p>
<p>The flip side of this budget process situation is that even if a company
believes it can solve a problem cheaply, they are incentivized to pad
estimates because no further funding can be requested in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-third-party-services">
<h2>No Third Party Services</h2>
<p>Third party services are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGP8DQIqxXs&amp;list=SPtqtTJ4wP09YOFqm_lBCoQtmS6S0omW3J&amp;index=29">near and dear to my heart</a>
because when properly leveraged developers can build applications
orders of magnitudes faster than by building everything from scratch.</p>
<p>The value proposition of third party services is clear. By paying
<a class="reference external" href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> $24 a month for instantly
integrated, powerful application-level monitoring, I don't have to rebuild
that functionality myself. New Relic has invested millions of dollars
into their platform. There's no reason for me to duplicate that functionality,
or the features of other platforms like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://copperegg.com/">CopperEgg</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
(the list goes on and on)
<strong>except to comply with often arbitrary government data regulations and information assurance questionnaires</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases these regulations are justified. In other cases, there is no
logical reason why data cannot be stored on an existing third party
platform. Explaining why though goes back to the justification problem
explained above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-want-everything-or-nothing">
<h2>&quot;I Want Everything, or Nothing&quot;</h2>
<p>The culture around government projects remains skewed towards &quot;big bang&quot;
project introductions. Gradually rolling out a new system to users is
rare. The idea is that &quot;unless every piece of functionality is there,
it is useless&quot; prevents systems from quickly getting into users' hands. Only
when users are actually working with a system can they can determine what
functionality is actually useful to them.</p>
<p>Government project phases are not iterative because they are often several
months or years long. Agile software engineering demands short feedback loops
on the maximum timescale of several weeks between production deployments.</p>
<p>In addition, government employee software developers and consultants
often recommend reasonable approaches to solving problems iteratively
but culturally there is significant resistance to those ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-quick-fixes">
<h2>No Quick Fixes</h2>
<p>The above problems are difficult issues to solve. Anyone with a &quot;silver
bullet&quot; for how government can easily build large complex software project
is selling snake oil. Increasing success rates on major government software
development projects will only come about through a combination of cultural
changes, greater technical understanding (by everyone involved in projects,
not just software developers), and a budget process that allows project
funding on less expensive iterative engineering methods.</p>
