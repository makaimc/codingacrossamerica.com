      <p>Outsourcing was once the biggest trend in the information technology world.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat">The World is Flat</a>
by Tom Friedman explained that while the United States was focused on fighting
terrorism after 9/11, the rest of the developing world was passing us by.
Global information access through the Web meant that soon you would be
better off born a poor but brilliant child in India than a B-student in
Minnesota.</p>
<p>Information technology outsourcing was one facet of a larger trend
that technology would break down geographic barriers. Students in the
United States, myself included, who were interested in software development
were advised against studying computer science since &quot;those jobs will all
be shifted to India soon anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Globalization is real but outsourcing all software development was undone
for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, the business landscape shifts so quickly that by the time an
organization writes an extensive requirements document and throws it over
the wall to developers in India, the software being built no longer matches
the current needs of the business.</p>
<p>Second, small teams of 2-5 developers and designers can now achieve orders
of magnitude greater output than decades past. The productivity differential
comes from code reuse through leveraging open source and a reduction in
waste from iteratively programming working software through
<a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile software development</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, time zone differences still matter. Working in a time zone ten to
twelve hours removed from the rest of your team causes friction. Friction
slows down the software development and allows competitors to pass you by.</p>

<h2>AgilityFeat</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://agilityfeat.com/">AgilityFeat</a> began as an agile consulting firm
with <a class="reference external" href="http://agilityfeat.com/commandos">Arin Sime</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ArinSime">&#64;ArinSime</a>) as the sole founder. Arin
worked with software development teams to either transition to an agile
model or optimize their team's existing agile workflow.</p>
<img alt="AgilityFeat's logo" src="../img/130310-agilityfeat/agilityfeat-logo.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Over a period of about six months, Arin thought through what it would take to
incorporate overseas development into the services he offered his clients.
But he knew that outsourcing to far away overseas countries was unlikely
to provide enough value to his clients to make it worthwhile.</p>

<div class="section" id="nearshoring">
<h2>Nearshoring</h2>
<p>There is a variation of outsourcing, known as
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearshoring">nearshoring</a> that mitigates
risk due to major time zone discrepencies. The software development team is
located in the same time zone as the business' location. Cost is reduced by
taking advantage of the lower cost of living in a different latitude.</p>
<p>For example, Washington, DC's cost of living is much higher than in
Richmond, Virginia. Business owners in
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.capitalone.com/">Capital One</a>'s
headquarters in McLean, VA just outside DC works with developers located
in Richmond to build their finacial systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, many of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.excella.com/">Excella Consulting</a>'s clients
work with a consulting team partially staffed by staff and students at the
Virginia Tech extension center in Blacksburg, Virginia. The mix of on-site
consultants combined with off-site developers creates a lower blended hourly
rate than purely on-site staff with the same results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="business-model-pivot">
<h2>Business Model Pivot</h2>
<p>How does nearshoring relate to AgilityFeat? Arin knew his business'
scalability was limited when it was just him doing agile consulting.
Over time Arin built relationships with partners in Costa Rica. Costa Rica's
low cost of living, relatively low crime compared with other Latin American
countries, and its proximity to the US (a three hour plane ride from Miami)
made the country appealing for nearshoring.</p>
<p>AgilityFeat pivoted from a purely agile methodology consulting company to
a nearshoring development shop that also offered agile consulting. The
combination of consulting and development services works well because
the development teams in Costa Rica also use the agile methodology to
build software.  AgilityFeat also focuses on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a>
model when building products for businesses trying to find their appropriate
customer base.</p>
<p>The combination of agile software development, nearshoring, and lean
startup methodologies works well for bringing software to market quickly
and validate hypotheses for how customers actually use a product.</p>
