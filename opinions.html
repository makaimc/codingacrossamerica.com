connotation is clearer if you append &quot;but I didn't plan it out that

<p>Events happen (or &quot;shit happens&quot; if you prefer that expression). It's
easy to ascribe attributes and reasons to those events afterwards.
The human mind works this way naturally. Ascribing reasons to ...

            <p>I'm writing this post from Kansas City, Missouri. One of the
things I find so striking here is how quiet it is downtown during the day
on weekends. Part of the lack of people may be due to the 100+ degree
weather, but my friend PJ who lives here says this is normal.</p>

At first I thought about digital SLRs, but the additional size, weight,

enough in learning the intricate details of tuning a camera or changing a
