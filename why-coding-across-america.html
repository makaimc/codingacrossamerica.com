<h1>Why?</h1>

      <p>Why travel across the United States for four months? There's a few ways to
approach this question, so I'll answer three variations separately then
bring it back together at the end.</p>
<p><strong>1. Why travel at all?</strong></p>
<p>I have lived in Virginia for the past ten years and New Jersey for the
previous eighteen since I was born. I do not consider myself
well-traveled even within the US. Most of my traveling has been to
visit friends on the East Coast. With the exception of a few excursions
to Austin, TX and Seattle, WA, I have not seen many places outside of
the mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>Does that matter? Maybe, maybe not, but I want to find out. I've spent the
better part of my 20s earning <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jmu.edu/">degrees</a> from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vt.edu/">various</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.virginia.edu/">universities</a>
which has helped me learn a lot and grow as a person, but I do wonder if
I'm missing a different perspective on life.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why travel across the US and not the entire world?</strong></p>
<p>I think there's a lot of value in traveling the world and seeing different
cultures. I also think that concentrating my time in the US will allow me
to focus more on technology culture here. I know many other countries have
interesting tech scenes, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia, but
I'm not as tied into those parts of the world.</p>
<p>On a more mundane level, I want to drive my car across the country. Staying
in the US also cuts down on logistics such as passports, cell phone
connections, and exchanging currency. Staying within the 50 states is just
<em>easier</em> in a lot of ways. I prefer spending my time focusing on technology,
coding, and talking to people within the US for this trip.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why travel for three to four months?</strong></p>
<p>I'm sure I could fly through several cities over a few weeks or spend an even
longer amount of time traveling. I think though that three to four months
is the sweet spot between feeling pressured to go-go-go and feeling like I
have too much time on my hands in every city. Moderate constraints often
produce better results than unhinged projects. On the other hand, too many
constraints, such as a very short schedule, wouldn't allow me to accomplish
what I'm looking to do on this trip.</p>
<p><strong>Wrap up</strong></p>
<p>Why four months? I need to get away from Washington, DC for awhile and gain
greater perspective on tech culture across the United States. Staying in
the United States cuts down on logistical issues and allows me to focus
on our tech culture. Four months provides a solid block of time to travel
to many cities and explore each one in unique ways.</p>
