            <p>“Many wealthy people are little more than the janitors of their possessions.”
- Frank Lloyd Wright</p>
<p>Several years ago I decided see if I could eventually
fit all my possessions in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_S2000">my car</a>.
Until recently, this goal seemed like an impossible task. Look at how small that
trunk is. The car has no back seat! I ...

            <p>Here are the main places and events I intend to visit while on the road.</p>
<p><strong>1. Meet ups</strong></p>
<p>I have been to a bunch of great meet ups in the Washington, DC area. I am
sure many of the destinations on the list also have great meet ups. I'll
lean heavily towards areas that I work in, such as Python, web development,
mobile development, and DevOps. However, if I see ...

            <p>It is important to focus on specific goals when undertaking any large
project. I consider four months away from work to travel a major project,
so here are my initial thoughts on what my goals are for Coding Across
America.</p>
<p><strong>1. Gain a greater understanding of tech culture across the United States</strong></p>
<p>There is only so much you can learn about other locations by reading ...

            <p>Why travel across the United States for four months? There's a few ways to
approach this question, so I'll answer three variations separately then
bring it back together at the end.</p>
<p><strong>1. Why travel at all?</strong></p>
<p>I have lived in Virginia for the past ten years and New Jersey for the
previous eighteen since I was born. I do not consider myself
well-traveled even within the ...
