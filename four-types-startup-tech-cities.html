<h1>Four Types of Software Developer Communities for Startups</h1>
  <div>
    By 
    <a href="http://www.mattmakai.com/pages/about.html">Matt Makai</a> on

      <p>After traveling to 30 cities over the past 5 months as part of my
<a class="reference external" href="/#intro">Coding Across America</a> project, I've discovered that entrepreneurs
can categorize cities into one of four types of software development scenes.</p>
<p>Software developers with a full stack skill set are necessary as a
&quot;raw input&quot; to an entrepreneurial culture. Over time, a startup scene without
access to software developers will wither and die as the entrepreneurs
move to cities with better tech scenes.</p>
<div class="section" id="type-1-severely-limited-tech-community">
<h2>Type 1: Severely Limited Tech Community</h2>
<p>Entrepreneurs in some cities find themselves with severely limited
access to software development talent of any type. To build and scale a
business with software as a major component (which most businesses today need
for differentiation), the business will likely have to move or open another
office in a different city.</p>
<p>For example, from my trip I found this issue to be the case in
<a class="reference external" href="/new-orleans-la.html">New Orleans</a>. NOLA has a thriving entrepreneurial
community with <a class="reference external" href="http://ideavillage.org/">IdeaVillage</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://4pt0.org/">4.0 Schools</a>, and events such as
<a class="reference external" href="http://ideavillage.org/how_it_works/noew/">New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week</a>.
However, the raw input pool of software developers is simply not large enough
to sustain an entrepreneurial community. I'm not trying to take away from
the software developers who are there - certain events like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/nolahacknight/">NOLA Hack Night</a> show that there
<em>are</em> developers. However, there are simply not enough of them given the
size of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Cities with a severely limited tech community should first incentivize
companies to hire software developers for local positions. In addition,
local leadership who run tech meetups are key to building a strongly bound
tech community. Once a small community is established, tech startups should
consider banding together to create
<a class="reference external" href="/hacker-houses-underused-resource.html">hacker houses</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-2-primarily-enterprise-development">
<h2>Type 2: Primarily Enterprise Development</h2>
<p>The second type of city has software development talent, although the talent
is geared towards narrowly scoped enterprise software skills, such as SOAP
web services. A developer can stay in a position for years generating XML
schemas for web services and not learn any other parts of a technology stack!
That type of developer would struggle mightily in a startup environment where
developers share responsibilities for all parts of the product until the
team scales to a sufficiently large size.</p>
<p>Non-technical entrepreneurs with a fledgling business are looking for
&quot;full stack&quot; developers who can build an entire product from the back
end database creation to the front end CSS design, as well as run the
application (or mobile app) in production.</p>
<p>Another challenge in these cities is that the culture often
discourages leaving an established job to take a risk at a startup. If a
startup fails, large enterprises are often reluctant to hire workers back
due to the mistaken view that time at a startup is similar to being unemployed.</p>
<p>Examples of this type of city are <a class="reference external" href="/memphis-tn.html">Memphis, TN</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/charlotte-nc.html">Charlotte, NC</a>, <a class="reference external" href="/dallas-tx.html">Dallas, TX</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="/omaha-ne.html">Omaha, NE</a>. Note however, Washington, DC is not included
in this category even though it shares many characteristics (DC falls in
type 3, next).</p>
<img alt="Main Street in Memphis, TN." src="../img/130808-four-types-cities/main-street-memphis.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Entreprise development type cities have a huge potential source for great
developers: pick out the best developers who are bored in their jobs and
have a passion for learning more. Hooking those developers into local tech
meetups with entrepreneurs and full stack developers provides an opportunity
to over time get them the broad skill set they'd need to succeed at a tech
startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-3-consulting-skewed">
<h2>Type 3: Consulting Skewed</h2>
<p>As I traveled and talked with tech startups and software developers
around the country I realized Washington, DC is an oddity in this list.
That's either a good or a bad thing depending on whether you think what
matters is entrepreneurship, or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">startups meant for rapid growth</a>.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is common in Washington, DC. But the easiest business to
start is a consulting firm. Think of the advantages: hire when someone else
is willing to pay for that person's salary (plus extra), minimal office
overhead since most consultants are on client site, and downsize headcount
if necessary when projects end. Yet these same forces that make it easy to
start a consulting business also push up the salaries to a point where
jumping to a scalable product-based startup creates too much risk versus
reward from a individual's financial standpoint.</p>
<p>Sure, some developers are attracted by the startup environment, a laid
back atmosphere, and the trendiness of working at a tech startup. But if
you're a great developer who's into that, why wouldn't you just move to
Austin, Texas? Without any other limiting factors, it would be silly
to deal with the high cost of living in D.C. and work at a tech startup.</p>
<img alt="The shadow of a flag flying in Washington, DC." src="../img/130808-four-types-cities/washington-dc.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Washington, DC.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I'm still on the fence as to whether Washington, D.C. can or should change
the consulting firm culture. I'll have more to say on this after I meet with
more members of the tech startup scene now that I have returned from
my trip.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-4-extensive-talent-massive-demand">
<h2>Type 4: Extensive Talent, Massive Demand</h2>
<p>The final type of scene I found in the United States was where there was
extensive talent throughout the city. However, massive demand by both startups
and large established tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
creates significant upward salary pressure.</p>
<p>Examples of these cities are <a class="reference external" href="/san-francisco-ca.html">San Francisco</a> (and
the whole Bay Area), <a class="reference external" href="/seattle-wa.html">Seattle</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/austin-tx.html">Austin</a>, and to a lesser extent,
<a class="reference external" href="/new-york-ny.html">New York City</a>.</p>
<img alt="The New York City skyline view from the East Village." src="../img/130808-four-types-cities/new-york-skyline.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>New York City skyline viewed from the East Village.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Extensive talent, massive demand type of cities need ways to train new
technical talent. A great
example is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> in Chicago.
Programs like The Starter League take people who have little to no
programming ability and in several weeks getting them over the steep
initial learning curve. Over time these types of programs create an influx
of tech workers with practical full stack skills. One area for improvement
will be engaging program alumni to make sure they are continuing to build
their skills after they graduate.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Those are the four broad categories I found. I'm sure some aspects will
change as I have time to reflect and discuss this subject further with
various tech communities. For example, I did not address the tech
communities found in university-centered cities such as
<a class="reference external" href="/charlottesville-va.html">Charlottesville</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/boulder-co.html">Boulder</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="/eugene-or.html">Eugene</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="/madison-wi.html">Madison</a>. If you find the subject interesting or have a
