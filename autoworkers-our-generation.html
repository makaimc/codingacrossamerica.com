<h1>Debate on the &quot;Autoworkers&quot; of Our Generation</h1>

    <div class="col-md-10 article-font">
      <p>Recently on Hacker News there were two blogs debating whether software
developers are the autoworkers of our generation. The first post was aptly
enough entitled
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.baugues.com/autoworkers">Autoworkers of Our Generation</a>.&quot;
The post's argument was that although software developers generally enjoy
great salaries now, there are looming &quot;threats&quot; (aka, solutions to the
current demand problem) on the horizon that could change the equation. For
example, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> in Chicago
turns out qualified Rails developers who can be hired by companies instead
of talent already on the market. The takeaway is to not get comfortable and
keeping learning and growing your skillset.</p>
<p>The second post was a response entitled
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://imsky.co/blog/not-autoworkers/">Not the autoworkers of our generation</a>.&quot;
The argument in this post was that autoworkers were granted a higher standard
of living for several decades due to labor unions' strong bargaining power and
because the work could not yet be automated to a significant degree. That
dynamic was destroyed particularly by automation (as well as other forces
such as manufacturing approaches and bureaucracy at GM, Ford, and Chrysler).
My guess is that the decreasing power of labor unions was driven not by
generational forces but instead by the weakening demand for unskilled labor.</p>
<p>The argument is that software development will not suffer such a fate because
developers perform highly skilled work that cannot be automated. Also, any
automation gains are qucikly swallowed by a corresponding increase in the
complexity of systems attempting to be built. Put another way, software
development automation does not go towards building the same systems for
less money, it generally goes towards making new and existing systems with
more business rules, features, and interconnections to other systems.</p>
<div class="section" id="my-perspective">
<h2>My Perspective</h2>
<p>As usual, I'm in the middle, although I lean towards the latter argument.
It's possible there will be much more entry-level talent to satisfy existing
demand if developer bootcamps are successful at turning out large numbers of
qualified developers. But there's so much work to be done at the high end,
such as teaching, mentoring, and reviewing those entry-level developers.
Then there's the building of the frameworks such as Rails and Django that
developers leverage to create the web applications in the first place (to
say nothing of mobile apps, embedded systems, etc etc), which is something
developers only get comfortable with after several years of experience. No
bootcamp today (or my guess, for the foreseeable future) can teach that type
of work.</p>
<p>I do agree with the first post's sentiment that if you want to justify
increasing your salary you need to constantly learn, grow, and challenge
yourself. Also, not just in the technical realm but also improving your
social intelligence, communications with team members, writing, and
understanding of business. I've unfortunately seen far too many &quot;architects&quot;
in big enterprises get laid off only to find they have no useful skills
because they failed to improve anything other than their domain knowledge
about their employer.</p>
<p>Generally though I don't currently see automation as much of threat to our
field. In fact automation is a value-add if you know how to use increasingly
sophisticated tools to accomplish your job that previously would have taken
several entry-level developers to complete.</p>
