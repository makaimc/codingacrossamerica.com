      <p>Since coding is in the title of this site and my trip across the country,
what will I be programming? Part of my excitement with the trip is having
focused, dedicated blocks of time to sit in coffee shops or restaurants
and work on projects I'm passionate about launching. While my development
projects often shift every six months to a year, I'm sure I'll be working
on some of all of the projects listed below in some capacity.</p>
<p><strong>1. ProofDriven</strong></p>
<p>In January 2012, I launched a web application where developers can go to
create custom financial reports to show that technology upgrades are
important investments for companies to make. The first design was... awful.
But, I launched! The new design is way better, despite the fact that I
designed it all myself instead of using a template. I give credit for the
aesthetic improvement to Bootstrapping Design and several design books
I read between the launches.</p>
<p>I plan to improve the way the site works and add new financial reports
that show how new specific technologies and processes provide a positive
return on investment. In addition, I will write blog posts on how
developers can encourage technical improvements in their work environments
even when their organization is technologically risk-adverse. Sure, it's
not the sexiest stuff, but it's important for helping drive improvements
in the way thousands of organizations across the country work.</p>
<p><strong>2. My &quot;Idea-Launch-Marketing-Iterate&quot; Personal Project</strong></p>
<p>I've found I unfortunately write a lot of boilerplate code and spend time
figuring some of the same things out each time I launch a personal project.
I'm trying to automate some of those boilerplate pieces with a centralized
web application that allows me to come up with ideas, launch and
automatically scale them with Linode/AWS/Heroku, then market the app, collect
and show metrics with statsd and Graphite, then iterate on promising ideas.
This project is still coming together but so far I like how it's going
and its potential.</p>
<p><strong>3. Excella Connect - Contact Management and Data Analysis for Excella</strong></p>
<p>I recently created a web application for Excella Consulting to better
understand our connections to different companies and industries. At first
I used LinkedIn data, but unfortunately LinkedIn imposes archaic and
shortsighted restrictions on the terms of use for their API. LinkedIn
just <em>doesn't get</em> how APIs should work to make them useful to third
parties. Someone is going to eventually disrupt their business by getting
things right.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if the forthcoming pilot initiative within Excella is
successful, I'll probably spend time developing functionality for the
product that will allow visualizations and data access to other internal
applications.</p>
<p><strong>4. Potential Client Web Apps I Can Develop Remotely</strong></p>
<p>If a new or existing client is looking for someone to develop a Python/Django
app, I'd consider spending up to 20 hours a week working on it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, it's likely these projects will change and new ones
will get added, but right now that's what I think of with the &quot;Coding&quot; part
of Coding Across America.</p>
