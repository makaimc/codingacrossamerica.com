that are used by the federal government? With billions of dollars* in
failed information technology projects over the last decade, there certainly
seems to be room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the issues with products built for government workers is that
commonly users who will actually work with the system do not control how
money is spent. Managers who will not be using the system are wowed by
great demos and flashy features. Yet many of those features are useless
to the real users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="HumanGeo's logo as seen from their office" src="../img/130220-human-geo/human-geo-logo.png" /&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HumanGeo, based in Arlington, Virginia across the Potomac River from
Washington, DC, appears to have a better model. Experts in military
intelligence at HumanGeo work directly with their top notch software
developers. Together they create elegant solutions to hard problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://goo.gl/maps/skkC2"&gt;&lt;img alt="HumanGeo's Arlington office location" src="../img/130220-human-geo/human-geo-arlington-office-location.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are granted freedom to use powerful technologies such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/collision.html"&gt;dynamic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063570"&gt;visualization&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html"&gt;creation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt; for cross-platform, meaning both dekstop
and mobile, interactive maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hbase.apache.org/"&gt;HBase&lt;/a&gt; for storing and accessing massive
amounts of data that can be feed into algorithms to create actionable
information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These free &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;
software libraries are commonly used by start ups and organizations that
have effective software development embedded in their culture. But the above
technologies (among many others) are rarely used in government projects.
Government employees and contractors are often hamstrung by a rigid set of
pre-approved technologies that cannot solve problems in effective ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the only tool available to you is a hammer, everything looks
like a nail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rigid toolset is indicative of larger organization dysfunction. When
the software development process does not work, well-meaning but
non-technical supervisors add more procedures and checkpoints. The
organization becomes content with failing in a structured way instead of
succeeding with a flexible approach to software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="change-the-approach"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change the Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HumanGeo's approach to solving problems in the intelligence space breaks
down barriers between real system users and software developers. Feedback
is immediate and clear. Relationships and trust are built between the experts
who understand their field and developers who understand a wide swath of
technologies. Once a product solves a problem, HumanGeo's well-respected
intelligence analysts help influence others in their community to take
notice. HumanGeo sells their products and consulting services around
effective solutions to real problems faced by users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HumanGeo's approach is not perfect, but it is a marked departure from
how many large firms in the Washington, DC region operate. Traditionally,
large DC government consulting firms sell a &amp;quot;butts in seats&amp;quot; model. Get
contractors in the door and let them essentially become staff augmentation.
Developers have limited freedom and influence to change the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Clint and Mike from HumanGeo" src="../img/130220-human-geo/clint-and-mike.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Clint and Mike, two developers at HumanGeo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of HumanGeo's developers came from other DC consulting firms that
follow that model. Some are my former coworkers. We saw first hand how
we were shipped off to a government site and put in a seat. We railed
against the inefficiencies from the inside without understanding the dynamic
that it was in the best interest of our employer to maintain the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers at HumanGeo are constantly experimenting with new technologies
and sharing that knowledge among members of the team. They also reach out
to the greater community through technology meetups such as
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Intel-Analytics-DC/"&gt;Intel Analytics DC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="government-as-a-platform"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Government as a Platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked HumanGeo's developers about
&lt;a class="reference external" href="../tim-oreilly-open-government.html"&gt;Tim O'Reilly's ideas on government as a platform&lt;/a&gt;. They agreed that having more raw data available through
APIs would help private industry create new applications for citizens.
There would need to be limits on access but there are principles of
public data sharing that also apply in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance"&gt;security cleared&lt;/a&gt; sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an interesting idea emerged from our discussion. How do you get
large public datasets from the government onto platforms where innovative
applications can be created? Downloading large data sets can take hours or
days and then it often needs to be uploaded into another environment.
Perhaps the government could partner with cloud services such as
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/"&gt;Rackspace Cloud&lt;/a&gt; to offer lower cost
access to public data on platforms that developers can immediately use to
do heavy data processing. It's an idea worth further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I interviewed a development team from a Washington, DC company
with a platform for making informed decisions about many aspects of personal
healthcare. My interview with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wisertogether.com/"&gt;WiserTogether&lt;/a&gt; comes up next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

be traveling to. Each of the songs has a different meaning - whether with
the city itself, such as Johnny Cash from Memphis, TN, a song about the
city, such as &amp;quot;Wide Awake&amp;quot; by Chris Cornell, or something personal to me.
Some of them are just personal favorite songs by artists who grew up or
got their start in that city.&lt;/p&gt;
