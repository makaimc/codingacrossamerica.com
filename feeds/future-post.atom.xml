I knew there was no way I was going to skip it or just spend a couple of days
there. Nothing less than a full week will suffice. In fact, much of my early
planning and building of this website was done while visiting Austin for a
week in June 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been to Austin three times previously. Every time has been amazing and
in different ways. There's something about the friendly culture, somewhat
liberal attitude mixed with hipster weirdness and technology start ups that
I find tremendously appealing. Plus Austin has some of the best bars anywhere
with 4th &amp;amp; 6th Streets. Weather is perfect since I prefer hot summer days
to cold dark winter nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered moving to Austin a few years ago but I nixed the idea since
it is so far from my East Coast roots. I decided instead to visit as often
as possible, but ultimately that just may not be enough for me once I finish
up my fourth trip there. Regardless, it's a great city and there was no
question it would be part of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="start-up-culture"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Up Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin has a great tech scene. It's the home of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sxsw.com/"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; conference in March every year.
Austin is often ranked highly on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/talkingtech/story/2012-08-22/top-tech-startup-cities/57220670/1"&gt;lists of best places to launch a tech start up&lt;/a&gt;
along with San Francisco, Seattle, Boulder, New York, and Boston. The
growth of Dell Computers in the late 80s and 90s helped the city to
establish its silicon credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current growing technology companies with an office in Austin include
Facebook, Google, NVidia, Indeed.com, Rackspace, and Zynga. University
of Texas is located in the heart of Austin and is at the forefront of many
areas in computer science and related disciplines. Smaller start ups
include The Daily Dot, Evernote, RightScale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of technology work in Austin. It's the first destination that
people who comment on my trip say &amp;quot;oh, that makes sense if you want to learn
more about technology across the country.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-research"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll &lt;a class="reference external" href="../austin-tx.html"&gt;post further notes&lt;/a&gt; as I continue to gather
more information about Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
