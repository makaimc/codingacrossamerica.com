      <p>There are over
<a class="reference external" href="http://ipod.about.com/od/iphonesoftwareterms/qt/apps-in-app-store.htm">800,000 apps</a>
in both Apple's iOS store and Google's Play store.</p>
<p>If you want to build a mobile app, why would you pay a development team
significant money to create it? Surely you can hire a smart teenager down
the block to &quot;build it for a few hundred bucks,&quot; right?</p>
<p>Or maybe you can build the app yourself. How hard can mobile app development
be when there are ways to create
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/ios-android-app-without-coding-appmachine">apps without coding</a>?</p>
<p>Hold on. Software development is <strong>hard</strong>. There is
<a class="reference external" href="http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf">no silver bullet</a>
for translating the ideas in your head into quality software that people
want to use. The key word here is <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are a particularly difficult type of software to
develop because apps require many parts. Some parts run on your phone while
others are housed in distant computing centers that your phone accesses over
its data connection.  Most of the time a user is completely unaware of the
interactions between these myriad technologies.</p>
<p>It's possible to throw together a mobile app with pre-built tools or by
hiring someone on the cheap. But the poor results can frustrate your users
and damage your brand.</p>
<p>Creating a cohesive user experience requires tight interaction between
programmers, designers, and the person or group with the ideas for the
mobile app. Firms that specialize in mobile app development bring together
software developers with expertise in mobile platforms, such as Android
and iOS, designers who specialize in creating mobile app user experiences,
and facilitators who can translate customers' abstract ideas into concrete
details.</p>

<h2>WillowTree Apps</h2>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.willowtreeapps.com/">WillowTree Apps</a> builds mobile apps for
organizations that know a poor mobile experience for their customers is
unacceptable. The Charlottesville, Virginia-based company has built the
Android and iOS mobile apps for well-known organizations such as the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nba.com/nets/nets-official-mobile-app">Brooklyn Nets</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/17/3164899/the-verge-app-now-available-for-android-and-ios">The Verge</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.virginia.edu/mobile/">The University of Virginia</a>,
and, as much as it pains me to say this,
the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/fanzone/mobile.html">Philadelphia Eagles</a>
(I'm a NY Giants fan).</p>
<p>WillowTree Apps is also branching out into development for embedded systems,
which is based on the recent incorporation of Android into computing areas
typically dominated by low-level and proprietary programming languages.</p>

<p>During our conversation in their office and over a Thai food lunch, something
became apparent to me as I asked questions based on my software development
knowledge: these guys are passionate about iOS and Android
development like I'm passionate about Python development. Understanding the
nuances of these platforms requires developers to have a passion for learning
outside a 9-5 job. That passion for building on mobile platforms combined
with designers equally passionate about user experience is a valuable
combination.</p>
<p>The development team is split between iOS-focused developers who program
in Objective-C and Android-focused developers who program in Java. Designers
work with each team interchangeably.</p>

<h2>Software Development in Charlottesville</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://goo.gl/maps/MJ7bh"><img alt="WillowTree Apps' office location in Charlottesville, Virginia" src="../img/130312-willowtree-apps/willowtree-apps-location.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Recruiting software developers in Charlottesville can be difficult because
it is not a major metropolitan area. Washington, DC is the closest major
city and Richmond, Virginia is about an hour away.</p>
<p>There are some advantages to Charlottesville though. First, WillowTree Apps'
office on the Downtown Mall is about a mile away from The University of
Virginia. Charlottesville is an attractive city to live after graduation or
to return to when raising a family. The Downtown Mall is a hub of great
restaurants, outdoor concerts, and eclectic independent stores.</p>
<p>WillowTree Apps also runs a local tech meetup for mobile app designers and
developers called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/cho-mobile/">ChoMobile</a> to foster
tech relationships in Charlottesville.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Charlottesville is a city of about 43,000 people. Yet here's a company
building high quality mobile apps for some of the biggest organizations
and sports franchises in the United States. That's a testament to the amount
of interesting technology work going on everywhere in the US.</p>
