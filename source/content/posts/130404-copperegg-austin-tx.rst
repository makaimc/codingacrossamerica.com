CopperEgg is tech company based in Austin, TX that provides a 
software-as-a-service platform for software infrastructure monitoring and
management.

CopperEgg's service started as a product for analyzing network traffic. After
the initial concept was built, the team realized they could apply similar
methods to other infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization, memory
usage, and storage performance. 

Monitoring server infrastructure is simple in theory, but becomes extremely
complicated when scaling to hundreds or thousands of servers. CopperEgg is
designed to solve that problem by giving continuous near real-time feedback 
to systems administrators and DevOps teams. 

One of the use cases we talked through is when development teams apply 
infrastructure changes to their production environments. The teams can then
immediately see the results of those changes through CopperEgg's metrics and
understand the impact of those changes. Writing similar monitoring software 
in-house would be an enormous undertaking which is why CopperEgg's 
software-as-a-service value proposition is an easy justification in  
infrastructure environments with many servers.

While at first it would appear that CopperEgg's offering is similar to 
`New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_'s platform, they are attacking monitoring
from two different perspectives.
