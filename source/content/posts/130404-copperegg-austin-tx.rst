CopperEgg is tech company based in Austin, TX that provides a 
software-as-a-service platform for software infrastructure monitoring and
management.

CopperEgg's service started as a product for analyzing network traffic.
The team realized after building the initial concept that they could 
apply similar methods to other valuable infrastructure metrics, such as 
CPU utilization, memory usage, and storage performance. 

Monitoring server infrastructure is simple in theory, but measurement 
quickly becomes complicated when scaling to thousands of servers. CopperEgg is
designed to solve that problem by giving continuous near real-time feedback 
to systems administrators and DevOps teams. 

One of the use cases we talked through is when development teams apply 
infrastructure changes to their production environments. The teams can then
immediately see the results of those changes through CopperEgg's metrics and
understand the impact of those changes. Writing similar monitoring software 
in-house would be an enormous undertaking which is why CopperEgg's 
software-as-a-service value proposition is an easy justification in  
infrastructure environments with many servers.

While at first it would appear that CopperEgg's offering is similar to 
`New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_'s platform, the companies are attacking 
monitoring from two different perspectives. New Relic's platform is geared
towards helping application developers figure out bugs in production 
application code. CopperEgg's service on the other hand is classified as 
infrastructure monitoring, similar to `Nagios <http://www.nagios.org/>`_, 
and is geared towards improving the tech stack below the application code.

One great marketing trick CopperEgg does is take their mascot, 
"`The Egg <https://www.facebook.com/copperegg>`_" with them to events while 
traveling to tech conferences and events. Here's

The CopperEgg team moved into a new office since I visited with them earlier
this year. Below is a picture of their old space downtown. Here's a

before moving out of their old office.
