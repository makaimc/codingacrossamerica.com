The main DjangoCon 2013 conference is kicking off this morning. Here's a quick
couple of pictures as people are getting settled down before the keynote.

I will be speaking Thursday morning on 
`Making Django Play Nice with Third Party Services <http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/presentation/47/>`_. Come find me or hit me up on Twitter if you're
