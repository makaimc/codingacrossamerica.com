Why Austin, TX?

Austin was the first city I put on the map during my road trip planning.
I knew there was no way I was going to skip it or just spend a couple of days
there. Nothing less than a full week will suffice. In fact, much of my early
planning and building of this website was done while visiting Austin for a
week in June 2012.

I've been to Austin three times previously. Every time has been amazing and
in different ways. There's something about the friendly culture, somewhat
liberal attitude mixed with hipster weirdness and technology start ups that
I find tremendously appealing. Plus Austin has some of the best bars anywhere
with 4th & 6th Streets. Weather is perfect since I prefer hot summer days 
to cold dark winter nights.

I considered moving to Austin a few years ago but I nixed the idea since
it is so far from my East Coast roots. I decided instead to visit as often
as possible, but ultimately that just may not be enough for me once I finish
up my fourth trip there. Regardless, it's a great city and there was no
question it would be part of my trip.
