On Monday night I gave a talk on 
`Git and Github workflows <http://www.mattmakai.com/static/presentations/memphis-python-github-workflows.html>`_
to 
`Memphis Python <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_. 
The venue, the Fedex Institute of Technology, at University of Memphis was
great. The turnout was fantastic with about 35 developers. I was pretty 
happy with how the talk went.

Thank you to `Brad Montgomery <https://twitter.com/bkmontgomery>`_ for
getting everything arranged months in advance,
`Douglas Starnes <https://twitter.com/poweredbyaltnet>`_ for the
introduction, and the Memphis Python community for having me in town!

I will post pictures from the event as soon as I get them from Douglas.
