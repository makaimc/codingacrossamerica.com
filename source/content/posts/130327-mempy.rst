On Monday night I gave a talk on 
`Git and Github workflows <http://www.mattmakai.com/static/presentations/memphis-python-github-workflows.html>`_
to 
`Memphis Python <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_. 
The venue, the Fedex Institute of Technology, at University of Memphis was
great. The turnout was fantastic with about 35 developers. I was pretty 
happy with how the talk went.

Setting up for my talk. I promise I don't always look this serious.
