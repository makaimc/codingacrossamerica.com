The P Street location for Commissary is right near Logan Circle. The inside
is large although on weekend during brunch it fills up quickly. I found
that sitting at the bar during the weekends with my laptop was fine. During
the week I could sit at a table and get service without feeling like a
nuisance.

There are two wifi hotspots in Commissary. I found the first one's connection
was spotty but when I switched to the second connection it was fast enough
for most use, including pushing image files to remote servers. There
were not many electric outlets so I recommend having a full charge on your
laptop battery before you come here.

Music and ambient noise was moderate. You can use headphones without turning
the volume up too loud. With a packed crowd the noise ratchets up quickly
so you may want to look for an alternative location if that bothers you.
