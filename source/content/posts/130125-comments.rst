I *finally* got around to adding a `Disqus <http://disqus.com/>`_-based
comments system to this site. Currently all blog posts and the city
research pages have an area for comments at the bottom.

The comment system needs to be tweaked. I'll probably modify it to
allow anonymous posts. There are probably other settings I can change
that will be beneficial.

Head over to the `cities <../cities.html>`_ page, pick a city, and write
up recommendations for what I should do and see while I'm there on my
trip.
