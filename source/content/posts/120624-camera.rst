I knew I needed a better camera than the one in my Droid 3 for this trip.
At first I thought about digital SLRs, but the additional size, weight,
and complexity turned me off to them. I am not currently interested 
enough in learning the intricate details of tuning a camera or changing a
lens to take the perfect picture. It is unlikely I would gain
any benefit from an SLR over a quality point-and-shoot camera.

After some basic web research, I settled on the 
`Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UMM1PO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=minimneeds-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006UMM1PO>`_ and a 
`Transcend 64 GB SDXC Flash Memory Card <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XIB9T6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=minimneeds-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004XIB9T6>`_. The camera got great reviews and the
memory card should have plenty of space for all the pictures I take. I'm
looking forward to using a real camera to post pictures of the people and
places in every city I stay in.
