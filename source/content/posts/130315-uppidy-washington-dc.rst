What would you do if you unexpectedly lost all of the text messages saved 
on your phone? Could AT&T or Verizon retrieve that data at your request?

The answer, shockingly, is no. Your own personal data is actually the 
property of your phone service provider. There is no way to retrieve "your"
data unless you have a court subpoena. Even with a subpoena the 
service provider will only grant you one week's history of your own 
personal records.

For most casual conversations the potential loss of data is not much of a
concern. But some situations are different. For example, what if one of 
the text message logs you lost were with a friend who died suddenly
after your conversation? There is no technical reason why keeping data 
for sentimental and nostalgic value is not possible.

There must be a better solution to this problem, especially as our 
communications increasingly become purely digital.
