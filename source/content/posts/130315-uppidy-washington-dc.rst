What would you do if you unexpectedly lost all of the text messages saved 
on your phone? Could you get them back from your phone service provider such
as AT&T or Verizon?

The answer, shockingly, is no. Your own personal data is actually the 
property of your phone service provider. There is no way to retrieve that 
data unless you have a court subpoena. Even with a subpoena the 
service provider will only grant you one week's history of your own 
personal records.

What if one of the text message logs you lost was with a friend
who died suddenly a short time after your conversation? There must be a
better solution to this problem, especially as our communications
increasingly become purely digital.
