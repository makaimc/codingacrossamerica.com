Quiet

I'm writing this post from Kansas City, Missouri. One of the
things I find so striking here is how quiet it is downtown during the day
on weekends. Part of the lack of people may be due to the 100+ degree
weather, but my friend PJ who lives here says this is normal. 

Compare the quiet here in Kansas City to the constant crowds that are 
out at all times of the day in Washington, DC or New York City. I often
have trouble hearing phone conversations while on the main roads when
I walk around Arlington or DC. Here there is a sort of calm settled over
the downtown area until night hits and the bar scene picks up.

*Downtown Kansas City. Pretty quiet until the sun sets.*

One of the explanations for why it is so quiet on the streets is that
there is a very car-centric culture in the Midwest. Actually, most of
America is car-centric with the exception of certain large cities that
have public transportation that works well. Most people just drive
directly to their destinations instead of walking and biking around.

Another explanation might be that Kansas City is behind the curve with the
trend in reverse urban flight. Perhaps it will take several more years of
revitalization in the downtown area before there are more crowds during
the day.

Anyway, this is just a quick observation of something I've noticed while
out here that is different from my expectations based on living in East
Coast cities. It'll be interesting to see how the 25-ish cities I'm
visiting next year fit in this pattern.
