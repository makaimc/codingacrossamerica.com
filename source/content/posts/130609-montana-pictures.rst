I spent a few days over the second weekend in June in both Missoula and 
Hamilton in Montana. I also stopped in Bozeman for 
lunch on the way to Wyoming. Montana is a beautiful state as I tried to
capture in the pictures below.

The amazing trail system in Missoula was perfect for walking, running,
and biking. Seriously every city should put this much effort into making it
easy for people to get around by means other than a car.
