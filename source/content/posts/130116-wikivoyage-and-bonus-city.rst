I just found out about `Wikivoyage <http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ today. I can't believe I did not know about it earlier. Wikivoyage is 
Wikipedia for destinations. I will use Wikivoyage extensively for this trip
as it complements my `cities <../cities.html>`_ pages.


I have a bonus city for this trip in April: Las Vegas. I am going to 
`Microconf <http://www.microconf.com/>`_ 2013 from April 28 through April 30.
I'll probably spend one extra day checking out Vegas before heading off to
Los Angeles. I'll also be at `Adobe MAX <http://max.adobe.com/>`_ the
weekend following Microconf.

I'm also looking at attending `UXMad <http://uxmad.com/>`_ while in Madison,
Wisconsin. `Lanyrd <http://lanyrd.com/>`_ is a godsend for finding these
types of events.
