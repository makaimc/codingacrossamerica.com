Latest Technologies
-------------------
Fletcher's currently working on scaling TrackMaven's increasingly popular
competitive marketing analysis service. Much of TrackMaven's processing is
done on 
`Heroku's PostgreSQL database servers <https://addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql>`_. 
He's evaluating how much of that processing can be moved to in-memory 
datastores such as `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ or 
`NoSQL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL>`_ options such as 
`Basho's Riak <http://basho.com/riak/>`_.

Much of TrackMaven's service is powered by `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
/ `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ web applications 
running on `Heroku <https://www.heroku.com/>`_. Heroku makes scaling a web
application easy initially but can become cost prohibitive with a large 
number of `dynos <https://www.heroku.com/pricing>`_, 
`addons <https://addons.heroku.com/>`_, and databases. 

Fletcher also works with a few `Linode <http://linode.com/>`_ instances that 
are part of TrackMaven's infrastructure. He and 
`Matt Camilli <http://www.trackmaven.com/matt.html>`_ 
are working with and evaluating 
`AnsibleWorks AWX <http://www.ansibleworks.com/ansibleworks-awx/>`_ 
for deploying, scaling, and maintaining more traditional LAMP servers that 
could in some cases replace Heroku.


Learning to Program
-------------------
Fletcher took an interesting path into programming and has only begun 
started web development in the last couple of years. Fletcher began using 
Python while in academia, but not in a computer science department. Learning
the basic syntax and how to cobble together various libraries provided a
"gateway drug" into the web development world.


Real Python
-----------
`Real Python <http://www.realpython.com/>`_ started as a 
`wildly successful Kickstarter campaign <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fletcher/practical-python-learn-programming-for-the-real-wo>`_.
The initial funding goal of $800 was far surpassed by the eventual $21,150
worth of pledges. 

Real Python now has four parts: Python syntax, 
web development, tool and topics, and projects. Further sections on data
analysis or interesting projects with `Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc/>`_ 
and `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ may be added in the future.


TrackMaven
----------
At a hackathon in D.C., Fletcher met 
`Allen Gannett <http://www.trackmaven.com/allen.html>`_, 
TrackMaven's founder. Although Fletcher considered working full-time on
Real Python, the opportunity to get in as a developer at the beginning of 
a very promising startup seemed too great to pass up. Since then Fletcher's
been working on building out the TrackMaven product and meeting the scaling
challenges due to high customer demand for their competitive marketing 
intelligence product.

Be sure to check out TrackMaven's 
`Pembroke Welsh Corgi mascot Maven <http://trackmaven.com/blog/2013/04/who-is-maven/>`_, 
probably the best tech startup mascot I've seen anywhere in the US.
