After a morning meeting with Tech Wildcatters I head to Austin, Texas.

The drive from Dallas, TX to Austin, TX.

----

I will hopefully avoid most of the city-to-city traffic on the Dallas to
Austin stretch so I can make it down there in about three hours. My estimated
time of arrival is about 3:30pm (Central Time).

Austin is destination number six of thirty for Coding Across America.

In Austin I will be meeting with several companies to discuss Austin's
vibrant tech scene.
