Living Out of Your Car
======================

I'm not planning to live out of my car while on my 4 1/2 month trip like
`this guy did while bootstrapping his start up <http://www.quora.com/Would-becoming-homeless-be-a-good-strategy-to-cut-costs-1>`_, but in a weird way
that is really impressive.

The guy really thought everything through - or at least fumbled into
a working situation. What I found most interesting is that he did it
out of a Honda Civic and not a minivan like `some people consider doing <http://boards.adultswim.com/t5/Babbling/i-am-seriously-considering-living-out-of-a-minivan/td-p/60020874>`_.

Hotels, Airbnb rentals, and friend's residences are the way for me to go.
Particularly since the old S2000's seats don't recline.
