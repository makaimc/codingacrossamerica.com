Causal Attribution

One of my least favorite quotes is "everything happens for a reason." The
connotation is clearer if you append "but I didn't plan it out that
way" onto it. I find the expression grating in seriously negative way.

Events happen (or "shit happens" if you prefer that expression). It's 
easy to ascribe attributes and reasons to those events afterwards. 
The human mind works this way naturally. Ascribing reasons to events 
after they happen is similar but not exactly the same as 
`hindsight bias <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight>`_, where events
in the past appear more predictable than ones in the future. It appears that
the actual term for explaining past events with reasons is
`causal attribution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_attribution>`_.

Why do I not like the expression? Because it's giving in to casual 
attribution afterwards instead of figuring out what you want ahead of time 
and going for it. The expression is demeaning to those who work really hard 
to achieve their goals. Those who use that expression are essentially saying,
"I didn't do anything I wanted to do, but that's okay because these other
things happened and I'll just say that's what was supposed to happen to
me all along."

I say no thanks to that mentality. If I want something, I'm going to figure
out how to get it and fuel my own relentless drive towards achieving that 
objective. When I get it I'm not going to say it was because it was 
just supposed to happen. I'm going to say I made it happen. I may have been 
helped by other people or fortunate circumstances (in almost all cases 
these are true), but I'm not going to discount the effort I put in to have 
things work out. The laissez faire attitude of "good things will happen 
just because" simply isn't for me.

That's why I'm going to make this trip happen. It's not just going to happen
because it's what is supposed to occur.
