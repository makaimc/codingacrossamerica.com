You've received an email from me asking if we can meet at your office or 
go out for lunch so that I can tell your story about solving interesting 
problems with software. This post attempts to answer some of the initial 
questions that may immediately come up on your side. 

After reading through this post I am sure you will have further questions. 
When you reach that point please email me with those additional questions at
matthew.makai@gmail.com. I will update this post throughout my trip with 
the most frequently asked questions. 


What is Coding Across America?
------------------------------
Coding Across America is a five month road trip from March until August 2013
that aims to tell stories about people solving problems using software. I am
traveling to thirty cities to meet with both large and small organizations.


Who Have You Already Met With?
------------------------------
I haven't started the trip yet, but in Washington, DC:

1. `HumanGeo <../human-geo-washington-dc.html>`_
2. `WiserTogether <../wisertogether-washington-dc.html>`_


Why Participate?
----------------
It's important to hold up individuals and organizations that are doing
amazing work not only in Silicon Valley but in every part of the country.
