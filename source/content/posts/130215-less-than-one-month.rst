Now things get interesting. There are only twenty two days remaining until 
I hit the road on March 9th. Later today I'll publish a post about 
Tim O'Reilly's fascinating talk about open government yesterday at one 
of my clients - the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Tim
discussed a range of topics, including how CFPB can continue to set an
example for transparency and openness in government.

At 430 I meet with `HumanGeo <http://www.thehumangeo.com/company.php>`_ 
at their office in Arlington, Virginia. HumanGeo's consultants specialize
in creating geospatial visualizations and develop software with Python.
Really sharp guys doing interesting software development.

Next week is `WiserTogether <http://www.wisertogether.com/>`_ in Georgetown.
Stay tuned.
