My updates have been less frequent over the past few days. I am shifting 
from primarily running around meeting with companies to doing more 
programming. There are also a couple dozen posts I need to finish writing,
even some from as far back as New Orleans and Memphis!

I will still be meeting with companies in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, 
and beyond. However, I'm trying to avoid having two or three meetings per
day so I have 
`large dedicated blocks of time <http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html>`_ 
in my schedule.

As I've traveled from city to city (thirteen as of this post), I've been
asked the same question everywhere. The question is one that significantly 
impacts tech startups from executing on their mission. Since the problem
has been asked everywhere I've gone, it appears to be a glaring, 
universal problem, at least in the United States. 

I fortunately have some background experience in the area so I'm looking to 
apply that domain knowledge along with my programming skill set towards a 
potential solution.
