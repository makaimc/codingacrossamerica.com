I am on the road to Dallas early today.

The drive from Memphis, TN to Dallas, TX.

----

The seven hour drive from Memphis to Dallas is a bit longer than the trek 
from New Orleans to Memphis. But this trip is easy compared to the twelve 
hour drive from Charlotte to New Orleans.

I have an afternoon meeting with `Startup Texas <http://startuptexas.co/>`_
though so I had to wake up and leave Memphis early enough to get down there.

Dallas is destination number five of thirty for Coding Across America.

During my time in Dallas I will be meeting with several accelerator programs,
startups, non-profits engaged with entrepreneurs, and generally taking in
the scene in my first ever visit to Dallas.
