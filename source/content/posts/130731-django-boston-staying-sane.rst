I was fortunate enough to be able to give a technical talk at 
`Django Boston <http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/100266532/>`_ 
on Wednesday evening. The presentation was created in 
`reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/>`_, an HTML5 and JavaScript 
framework. Here are some pictures from the event as well as links to the 
video of the presentation and associated slides.

Here I'm discussing the project structure variations between 1.3, 1.4+, and 
customized projects.
