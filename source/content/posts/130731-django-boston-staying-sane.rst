I was fortunate enough to be able to give a technical talk at 
`Django Boston <http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/100266532/>`_ 
on Wednesday evening. The presentation was created in 
`reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/>`_, an HTML5 and JavaScript 
framework. Here are some pictures from the event as well as links to the 
video of the presentation and associated slides.

This talk is based on a blog post I published which provides 
`a checklist for evaluating existing Django projects <http://www.mattmakai.com/django-project-checklist.html>`_.

customized projects.

Awkward shot... I must talk with my hands a lot.
