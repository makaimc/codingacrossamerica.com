After a fantastic week in New Orleans, I'm heading up to Memphis, 
Tennessee for a four day visit.

The drive from New Orleans, LA to Memphis, TN.

----

Memphis is destination number five of thirty for Coding Across America.

During my time in Memphis I will be meeting with founders from 
`Launchpad Memphis <http://www.launchmemphis.com/launchpad/>`_, 
having dinner with 
`Seed Hatchery <http://www.seedhatchery.com/>`_, 
and `speaking at MemPy <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_ about Github
workflows.
I'll also finally catch up on client work and finish up several blog posts
still in progress.
