92% of people in the United States use their phones to send text messages. 
We rely so heavily on text messaging that most of us take the service for
granted. Texting is just part of our daily lives.

But what would you do if you unexpectedly lost all of the text messages
on your phone? Could AT&T or Verizon retrieve that data at your request?

The answer, shockingly, is no. Your "personal" data is actually the 
property of your phone service provider. There is no way to retrieve the
data unless you have a court subpoena. Even with a subpoena the 
service provider will only grant you one week's history of your own 
personal records.

For most casual conversations the potential loss of data is not much of a
concern. But some situations are different. For example, what if one of 
the text message logs you lost were with a friend who died suddenly
after your conversation? There is no technical reason why keeping data 
for sentimental, nostalgic, or business value is not feasible.

There must be a better solution to the data retention problem. Our 
communications today outside face-to-face meetings are now almost entirely 
digital.
`Josh Konowe <http://www.cit.org/service-lines/entrepreneur-of-the-week-joshua-konowe/>`_ 
founder of `Uppidy <http://www.uppidy.com>`_ in Washington, DC, has a 
potential answer to the current lack of control over our own messaging data.

Uppidy is an app for Android, BlackBerry, and iOS phones that saves
your text messages for later viewing. A user can then search through and 
read their text message archives. The Wall Street Journal 
`detailed how Uppidy and another app, Calltrunk <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304432704577349881132834906.html>`_ 
work early last year. 

The Uppidy app saves your messages from your phone to its cloud service. 
The app then provides you a window into the stored data at your convenience.

Discovering the Business Model
------------------------------
The Uppidy team is working to find the right revenue model for its service.
The app current shows advertisements, similar to how Gmail works, as one 
form of revenue.

Another promising revenue source is from large enterprises that are looking
to store employees' messages in a secure, private environment. Uppidy could
provide value to enterprises by allowing employees view prior business 
conversations when their devices are lost, broken, or are upgraded. 


What's Next?
------------
Josh and I had a wide ranging discussion not only about Uppidy as his most 
recent company (he started and sold two previous companies) but also about 
Washington, DC entrepreneurship in general. I will detail that part of our 
conversation in a future post.
