I recently remarked to someone I was talking to about my trip that it is
odd knowing I will not be in Washington, DC at this same time next year.
I've lived in Virginia for the past eleven years (4 @ JMU, 2 in Arlington,
2 1/2 in Charlottesville, 2 1/2 back in Arlington). It's easy to fall into
a trap of taking things for granted when you know you always have them at
your disposal. For instance, I don't check out the national monuments at
all except when I have family or friends visiting from out of town. It's
easy to get caught up in thinking that you can do that sort of thing 
whenever. Whenever often turns into never.

It's important to know that you will not have forever to experience the
particular advantages of your location. Knowing your time is limited
forces you to enjoy the things around you that you know you'll miss once you're far off. Jumping
forward one year and knowing that I will likely be in Seattle at that time
allows me to realize how limited the remainder of my time here will be. Of
course I'm planning to come back to DC after my trip, but who knows where
life takes me once I'm traveling across the country. Better to use
limited time I have here and truly enjoy DC rather than continue to
in some ways waste the great parts of this city by not taking advantage of
its unique aspects that I won't get anywhere else in the US.
