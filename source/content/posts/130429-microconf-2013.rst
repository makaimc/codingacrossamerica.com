I'm in Las Vegas, Nevada for MicroConf 2013 today and tomorrow.

MicroConf is a conference focused on bootstrapped startups and single founder
software companies. 

The conference organizers' perspectives is one of the best parts. Their 
attitude is dismissive of the idea that if your startup doesn't take 
venture funding or rise to a billion dollar valuation, then it's a failure. 
Success instead can be defined by solving real problems for your customers 
and making a good living building a business you love.

The videos from last year's 
`MicroConf 2012 <http://www.microconf.com/videos-2012.html>`_ were 
incredibly insightful. So I figured I'd make attending a tech conference the 
purpose of my first ever trip to Vegas. Further updates on MicroConf 2013
coming later.
