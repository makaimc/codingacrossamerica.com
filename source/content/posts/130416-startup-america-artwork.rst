At the afternoon sessions on April 16 during the Startup America Regional 
Summit in Phoenix, Arizona, Autumn Farrell 
(`@autumndawnf <https://twitter.com/autumndawnf>`_) drew artwork to 
visually capture the advice from panelists throughout the afternoon.

Autumn drew each concept with her own flair as the panelists discussed how 
to hire people smarter than yourself, seek mentors, and find creatives to 
combine art with technology.

I was impressed enough to grab this snapshot of the board Autumn drew on.
