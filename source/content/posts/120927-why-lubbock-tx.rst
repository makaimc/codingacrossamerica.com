Why Lubbock, Texas?
===================

Lubbock is home to the Red Raiders of Texas Tech University and is about
seven hours Northwest of Austin, Texas. Lubbock will be the seventh city
I visit during Coding Across America. This stop begins the leg of my trip
that will take me to some remote place in the Southwest United States, 
including Los Alamos, Moab, and Flagstaff.

It will be difficult to find technology-related ventures in Lubbock outside of 
Texas Tech University. An Indeed.com search for Django and Ruby on Rails 
turned up... nothing. Ditto for tech meetups. But in lieu of other software
developers to talk to, I'm looking forward to spending some time here in
an area of the United States I would otherwise be unlikely to visit. It's
also a great excuse to get plenty of time for heads-down coding.

Start Up Culture
----------------
Not much here from what I can find. I'll have to do further digging to see
if Texas Tech University sponsors any type of incubator or entrepreurship
classes.


More Research
-------------
I'll `post further notes <../lubbock-tx.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about Lubbock.
