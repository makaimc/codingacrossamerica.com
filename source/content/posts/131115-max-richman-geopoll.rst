There's a wide spectrum of when software developers learn to program.
At one extreme of the spectrum there are programmers who learn to use 
computers when they are very young. One the other end there are programmers
who learn later in life out of necessity. Max's path into progamming begins
closer to the second extreme while working on his Master's degree in 
statistics.


Learning to Program
-------------------
Max's first exposure to programming came during undergrad at George Washington
University with a course taught in Delphi Pascal, but it wasn't until his 
Master's program at the London School of Economics (LSE) that he fully 
engaged with software development. At LSE Max did significant programming 
with SAS and other statistics-first languages. He also wrote web scrapers
to collect unstructured data from the web before transforming the data into
structured content. 

After LSE, Max shifted into to the open source world of statistics languages, 
primarily `R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_. Max also used Python for data 
processing and geospatial mapping software such as Quantum GIS for displaying 
resulting data sets. 

Max now combines his statistics, geospatial information systems (GIS),
and software development experience with his interest in emerging global
markets for `GeoPoll <http://research.geopoll.com/>`_ and 
`DataKind <http://www.datakind.org/>`_. 

GeoPoll
-------
GeoPoll is Washington, D.C.-based research and firm that conducts surveys
through mobile devices. The mobile approach is particularly useful for
collecting data from third-world countries where mobile phone penetration 
is high but other infrastructure is sparse.


Volunteering for DataKind
-------------------------
`DataKind <http://www.datakind.org/>`_ is a volunteer organization based in
New York City that pairs data scientists and non-profit organizations 
together to create data science solutions to problems those organizations 
face when working to achieve their missions.
