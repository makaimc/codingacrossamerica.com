There's a wide spectrum of when software developers learn to program.
At one extreme of the spectrum there are programmers who learn to use 
computers when they are very young. One the other end there are programmers
who learn later in life out of necessity. Max's path into progamming begins
closer to the second extreme while working on his Master's degree in 
statistics.

Learning to Program
-------------------
Max's first exposure to programming came during undergrad with a course 
taught in Delphi Pascal, but it wasn't until his Master's degree program
at the London School of Economics (LSE) that he fully engaged with software 
development. At LSE Max did significant programming with SAS and other
statistics-first languages. After the program he shifted into to the open
source world of statistics languages, primarily 
`R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_. Max also used Python for data processing
and GIS software for mapping resulting data sets.

New York City that pairs data scientists and non-profit organizations 
together to create data science solutions to problems those organizations 
face when working to achieve their missions.
