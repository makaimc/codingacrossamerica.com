Breadth Versus Depth
====================

One of the things I constantly struggle with in my software development 
consulting career is balancing breadth versus depth.

When I graduated from `JMU <http://www.jmu.edu/>`_ in 2005, I was 
not deep in anything related to my career. I had a very broad knowledge 
of computer science, Java programming, and a few pointers for where I 
should look next to learn more. I started working in an enterprise
environment developing software (a really disfunctional environment - but
that's another story) at Freddie Mac. I expanded my breadth in learning
about version control systems, configuration management, handling myself
on a team of developers, and many other real world software development
topics. I became deeper in my knowledge of Java and the Java Virtual
Machine stack.

At the same time, I deepened my knowledge of computer science while taking
classes at `Virginia Tech <http://www.vt.edu/>`_ to earn my Master's degree.
I dove deep into the relatively obscure realm of genetic algorithms and
their application to software testing.

Throughout my seven year career to date, I've bounced back and forth between
depth and breadth. I made a conscious decision to focus on Python development
once I picked it up in 2007 and ran with it. The tradeoff was a regression
in my depth in the JVM stack (although I still find 
`Clojure <http://clojure.org/>`_ very interesting) for a depth in the
Python ecosystem.

This relates to Coding Across America in a direct way because I do struggle
with how long to spend in each city. Certainly if I spent all four months
in Austin, TX, I'd learn a lot about the city, the people who live there,
the local spots to check out, and the technology scene there. I could
inundate myself in Austin's culture. But that wouldn't serve the goal I'm
trying to achieve on my trip.

A few weeks ago when I spent six solid days in Austin, it felt like a
good amount of time to get to know the area. However, I had already been
to Austin for long weekends a couple of times. On the other hand, I did not 
exhaustively research where to go in Austin before my trip. So I'm hoping
a combination of research and discussing with people who've lived in cities
before is enough to get me over the learning curve of understanding a
location so that 5-10 days in most cities is enough.

Perhaps that's erring on the side of breadth, but that's the goal. This
isn't a trip about Coding Across Memphis, TN. It's about the United States
as a whole. Better to have more destinations with shorter stints in cities
both large and small rather than a few longer stays in cities that may
skew the results towards a vision that isn't accurate (say, Palo Alto, 
Seattle, Austin, and Boulder for instance).
