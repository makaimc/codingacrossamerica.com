Yesterday I arrived in `New Orleans <../new-orleans-la.html>`_, Louisiana 
after a long twelve hour drive down from Charlotte, North Carolina.

I am here participating in `IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_'s 
`New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week <http://ideavillage.org/how_it_works/noew/>`_ 
(NOEW).

There are teams of MBA students helping local entrepreneurs work on
their business ideas. I will be assisting the groups, including one this
afternoon. Keynote speakers will give their input throughout the week, 
including
`Walter Isaacson <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson>`_, 
a New Orleans native, who authored the Steve Jobs' biography. 
There are also many learning sessions on both technical topics and 
entrepreneurial subjects.

My primary goal here is to help out teams from a technical perspective since
the conference often has a dearth of that expertise. I am also talking to
as many New Orleans natives to find out more about their experiences in
entrepreneurship here.
