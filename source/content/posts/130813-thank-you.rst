After five months and thirty cities, I've returned to our nation's capital. 
My time on the road was a tremendous opportunity to spend significant time
outside the D.C. bubble and learn from amazing people that I otherwise would
not have had an opportunity to interact with. 

I want to use this post to highlight and thank all the organizations I met 
with around the country. In addition, I want to highlight some exceptional
people who really went above and beyond to help me learn from their local
tech community.

Talks
-----
Also a huge thanks to the organizations and meetup groups that invited me
to give talks. While I often speak in DC, it was amazing engaging in
discussion with communities from coast to coast.

* `MemPy <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_ (Memphis, Tennessee)
* `EvoNexus Community <https://twitter.com/COMMNEXUS_SD/status/329278052855054336>`_

  (Omaha, Nebraska)
* `Django Boston <http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/100266532/>`_ 
  (Boston, Massachusetts)

I also have an upcoming talk in Chicago at DjangoCon on September 5 and
another talk in DC on Sept 25. After that, I'm hoping to cool it a bit for
a couple of months.

There's been so many people along the way that have been incredibly helpful
and generous. Thank you all for helping me with my Coding Across America
project.

I will be writing a post on what's next, but the gist of it is to apply
what I've learned along the way to the DC tech and startup community. I have
many meetings set up with organizations here in the DC area and I look 
forward to spreading the knowledge, making connections, and generally
paying it forward as I was able to do throughout my trip.
