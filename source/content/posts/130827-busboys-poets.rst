The 5th and K St Busboys spot is one of two locations they have in downtown
Washington, D.C. This place is huge, with two floors and a large outdoor
patio. On weekends it can get extremely crowded for brunch. During the
week there's a relaxed atmosphere and you can pretty much hang out on your
laptop all day without anyone minding.

This is a great spot for getting some coding done. There is fast, open wifi
with great coverage. Electric outlets are plentiful under the bar and near
some tables - particularly the booths against the back wall. 

The music loudness varies. Sometimes I found I could easily listen to my
headphones at normal volume while other times I had to turn the sound up.
On weekends the place is loud with large crowds talking so it's less 
comfortable to sit and work for hours at a time.
