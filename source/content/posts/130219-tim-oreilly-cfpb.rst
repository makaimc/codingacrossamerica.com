Tim O'Reilly on Open Government

`Tim O'Reilly <https://twitter.com/timoreilly>`_ came to the
`Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <http://www.consumerfinance.gov/>`_
(CFPB) on Thursday, February 14th. Tim discussed a range
of topics centered on open government and transparency. I attended Tim's talk
as part of the greater Technology & Innovation team although he 
primarily came to talk with our new 
`design and technology fellows <http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/design-technology-fellows/>`_. 
I thought it would be interesting to share his ideas with a wider audience. 
I've grouped the topics together in this post around the ideas - the 
ordering here is not necessarily how the discussion was structured. There 
were a lot of questions that directed the conversation. Any errors and 
omissions are mine.

Government as a Platform
------------------------
The US government can often create the greatest public benefit by building
platforms that citizens and the private sector can extend. A widely-known 
example is 
`GPS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System>`_. 
GPS was initially built by the military and then later opened for public use.
The applications that are now possible for navigation and positioning would
not have been possible if the military alone created the end user 
applications.

Open source is a key part of government as a platform. Luckily CFPB has
already `open sourced <https://github.com/cfpb>`_ applications on Github.
The agency is hoping to open source even more software, particularly the
internal communication and collaboration tools we've built over the past
couple of years. I developed many of those projects so if they are open 
sourced I'll be sure to write posts about the best ways to build on top
of them (they are written in `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and 
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_).

Serve and Create Heroes
-----------------------
Tim exhorted the Fellows and other CFPB public servants to always remember
to *serve the People*. Sometimes we get caught up in daily tasks and petty
inter office politics. Always take a step back and realize we serve a greater
purpose.

CFPB should broadcast achievements as the agency executes its mission. Hold
people up as examples and heroes so others want to be like them. The public
needs to know and understand that great work is being done in many parts of
the government. Stories about individuals that are relatable and memorable
bridge the gap between nameless, faceless agencies and the public servants 
who work hard to achieve an agency's mission.


The "Next Big Thing"
--------------------
One of the CFPB fellows asked "what's the next big thing" along the lines
of Web 2.0. Tim explained that there is never just one major thing. 
Generally several novel or materially improved technologies combine to
create "the next big thing." Today, the two technologies on the horizon
that have the potential for great change are pervasive sensor networks
and new techniques for large scale data analysis - "big data" is the term
being thrown around.

One example of how sensors, data, and large scale analysis combine came
from Tim's discussion with `Peter Norvig <http://norvig.com/bio.html>`_ 
at Google. Peter described Google's self-driving cars as a triumph of memory,
not algorithms. The process of mapping the roads for Google Maps allowed
large scale data collection that could be analyzed. The outcome of that 
analysis (which is ongoing, not a discrete one-time process) 
combined with brilliant engineering leads to capabilities for autonomous
vehicles.


Legislation and Technology
--------------------------
Tim discussed how technologists have an opportunity to get *ahead* of policy
makers. We in the software development community have a responsibility to 
show how technology can be used for good. We also must warning against the
dangers that can arise from misuse. 
 
I find topics of government as a platform and what the government can do
to encourage technology entrepreneurship fascinating. These are major themes
for this blog over the next five months as I travel to 
`30 cities around the United States <../cities.html>`_ and interview other
developers. Within the next day I'll have Friday's interview with 
`HumanGeo <http://www.thehumangeo.com/company.php>`_ posted. Next up is
`WiserTogether <http://www.wisertogether.com/>`_.
