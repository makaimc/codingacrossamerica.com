Research

I have not posted on this blog in a few weeks but work continues on
researching my thirty destinations. I constantly add potential tech 
companies to their respective city pages as well as meet up groups and 
interesting spots to visit.

I already have a great group of both large and small tech companies with
confirmed visit dates in various cities. Once I get a little closer to my
launch date on March 9, I'll post the companies and the times I will be
visiting their offices. Having a known set of dates I will
be in each city really helps with confirming office visits as well as
meet ups.

Also on my to do list is getting comments put on each city page and blog
post. It's easy to implement but I haven't gotten around to it. Random
other projects have taken precedence such as my quick one weekend web app
side project
`Visualization Portfolio <http://www.visualizationportfolio.com/>`_, 
working with my consulting firm on potential new Python clients, and knocking
out great work at my current clients before I hit the road.

Now is about the time when things come together as my research fills in
most of my destinations, I book accomodations in more cities, and I confirm
with even more companies about visiting and talking to them about what they
love (and don't love) about working in technology in their city. Much more
to come soon.
