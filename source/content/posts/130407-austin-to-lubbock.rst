The drive from Austin, TX to Lubbock, TX.

----

Nothing against Lubbock. Austin is just an amazing city with great weather,
friendly, tech-savvy people, and a fantastic startup scene. I've really
enjoyed my time here for the past several days.

Lubbock is destination number seven of thirty for Coding Across America.

Lubbock is a "catch up" spot, where I'll be finishing up all the content
I've drafted but not published from New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas, and Austin.
I will also check out Texas Tech and some of the local museums.
