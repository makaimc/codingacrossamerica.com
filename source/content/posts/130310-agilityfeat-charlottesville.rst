Outsourcing was once the biggest trend in the information technology world.
`The World is Flat <http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat>`_ 
by Tom Friedman explained that while the United States was focused on fighting
terrorism after 9/11, the rest of the developing world was passing us by.  
Global information access through the Web meant that soon you would be 
better off born a poor but brilliant child in India than a B-student in 
Minnesota. 

Information technology outsourcing was simply one facet of a larger trend
that technology would break down geographic barriers. Students in the 
United States, myself included, who were interested in software development 
were advised that "those jobs will all be shifted to India soon anyway." 

Globalization is real but outsourcing was undone for several reasons. First,
the business landscape shifts so quickly that by the time a large organization
writes an extensive requirements document and throws it over the wall to
developers in India, the software being built no longer matches the needs of
the business. Second, individual developers and small teams of 2-5 developers
can now achieve orders of magnitude greater output than decades past.
The productivity differential comes from code reuse through leveraging open
source and a reduction in waste from iteratively programming working software 
through `agile software development <http://agilemanifesto.org/>`_.
