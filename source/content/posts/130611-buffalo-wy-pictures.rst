Buffalo, Wyoming is one of the two stops I picked to hang out a few days
on the long trek from Seattle to Boulder. Luckily the weather has been
sunny and clear here so I could snap these great pictures. The photos are
from a combination of driving through the mountains, walking around 
Sheridan, Wyoming, and Buffalo itself.

View from Big Horn National Park almost 10,000 feet up. This picture
