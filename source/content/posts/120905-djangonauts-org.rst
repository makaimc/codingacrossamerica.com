`djangonauts.org <http://djangonauts.org/>`_ is a well done centralized 
website for Django meetups across the United States. The Chicago Users Group 
originally registered the domain name for their own purposes but then 
realized it would be of benefit to the greater Django community to have
a centralized location for all users groups.

I found out about the website during a lightning talk during DjangoCon 2012.

I'll be using djangonauts.org to contact Django users groups in each city 
that I will be visiting in 2013. Hopefully I can meet with most of the groups
on the list.
