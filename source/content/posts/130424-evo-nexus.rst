EvoNexus is a startup incubator located in downtown San Diego.

EvoNexus is the incubator under the umbrella organization CommNexus, a
non-profit focused on increasing the prevalence of high tech startups in 
San Diego. Companies in EvoNexus obtain free office space and access to a 
network of fellow companies and investors in the area.

One of EvoNexus' current companies is 
`Antengo <../antengo-san-diego-ca.html>`_, which I previously wrote about.
EvoNexus has an array of companies in its 
`current incubation class <http://www.commnexus.org/incubator/incubator-companies/downtown.php>`_ 
and `graduated alumni <http://www.commnexus.org/incubator/incubator-companies/alumni.php>`_.

EvoNexus is working to become a hub of entrepreneurial and tech activity
downtown, similar to `Capital Factory <../capital-factory-austin-tx.html>`_
in Austin and `Seed Spot <../seed-spot-phoenix-az.html>`_ in Phoenix.

Most companies that graduate from EvoNexus move a few blocks down the street.
Having the current incubation class and alumni companies in the same vincinity
helps cohesion for the downtown San Diego startup community.

One final note, I gave a talk at EvoNexus on some of the lessons I've learned
while traveling for Coding Across America. I've 
`posted my slides <http://www.mattmakai.com/static/presentations/san-diego-evonexus-startups.html>`_ with the caveat that I tend towards using slides as
enhancements to a talk instead of information repositories.
