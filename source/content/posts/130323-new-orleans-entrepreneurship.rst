I just spent the past week in New Orleans (NOLA) at IdeaVillage's 
`New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week <http://www.noew.org/>`_ (NOEW). This is
only my `third city of thirty <../about.html>`_ over the next five months so I
can't yet draw any big picture conclusions. However, it feels like
something special going on down here in "Silicon Bayou". Here's how you
can plug into the growing entrepreneurship and tech scene.

and `Archie Manning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Manning>`_, 
asking questions of three entrepreneurs who pitched that afternoon.

What NOLA Needs
---------------
There are not enough talented technical people in NOLA. Technical co-founders 
and software developers are very difficult to find here. One YCombinator alum,
Kumar Thangudu, who just moved to New Orleans said "tech folks down here are 
treated like gods."
