The logo for `Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/>`_
came from a 
`contest <http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/coding-across-america-167494>`_ 
on `99designs <http://99designs.com/>`_. This was my first experience
with 99designs. Overall I am really happy with how I spent my $299. This post
will help you avoid some of the rookie mistakes I made so that you get the
most value out of your experience.
