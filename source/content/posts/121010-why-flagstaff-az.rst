Why Flagstaff, AZ?

Flagstaff is the last stop in the leg of my trip that is primarily composed
of small towns and beautiful outside scenery. This is destination number ten during
Coding Across America.

Why Flagstaff instead of Phoenix, which is only a couple hours further South? No particular
reason. Having four stops in a row that will be pretty small towns before hitting the 
San Diego-Los Angeles-San Francisco West Coast corridor will be an interesting contrast
though.

Start Up Culture
----------------
The University of Northern Arizona has its 
`Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology <http://www.nacet.org/>`_. So there's some
signs of life here. I'll be on the look out over the next couple of months for small
start ups and companies that are located around here.


More Research
-------------
I'll `post further notes <../flagstaff-az.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about Flagstaff.
