I am substituting a stop in `Phoenix <../phoenix-az.html>`_, 
Arizona for my planned trip to Flagstaff. The switch was made after much 
feedback from people in Memphis, Dallas, and Austin.

I will still drive through Flagstaff on my way to Phoenix on Sunday 
but I won't be stopping overnight.

My time in Phoenix will coincide with the Startup America Regional Summit
on the 15th through the 17th.
