CO+HOOTS was started by `Jenny Poon <https://twitter.com/poondingo>`_ about 
three years ago. Before starting her co-working space, Jenny worked on 
independent graphic design contracts at home. She was bored without social 
interaction and it negatively impacted her design creativity. Jenny got a 
group of fellow entrepreneurs and started CO+HOOTS.

I was introduced to Jenny and CO+HOOTS through Gabe and Blaine on the 
Phoenix `Uber <https://www.uber.com/>`_ team. Uber's Phoenix operations,
as well as many other companies and independent designers and developers,
work out of CO+HOOTS.

Their current space just opened three months ago. As the picture below
shows, it's already filled up close to capacity.

There are not a lot of working space options besides coffee shops for 
creative professionals in Phoenix. CO+HOOTS fills an underserved need in
the downtown area. The space felt like a more polished, smaller 
`Vuka <http://www.vukaaustin.com/>`_ in Austin, Texas
and similar to 
`The Common Desk <http://thecommondesk.com/>`_ in the Deep Ellum area of 
Dallas, Texas.

Independent designers and developers are unlikely to purchase traditional 
office space because it is expensive, boring, and disrupts social 
interaction. Cities that lack a strong design community such as Washington, 
DC would benefit from having more co-working space like CO+HOOTS.
