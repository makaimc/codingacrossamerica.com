Why Memphis, Tennessee?

Several of my DC friends previously lived in Memphis and recommended that
I visit the city while I am travelling through Tennessee. There's great
BBQ, high recommendations for 
`Beale Street <http://www.bealestreet.com/wordpress/>`_, and a different 
Midwestern culture that an East Coast kid like me should find interesting.  
Memphis is only three and a half hours from my previous stop in Nashville. 
Plus it takes me further Southwest towards my next destination, New Orleans. 

So a combination of convenience and interest combine to make Memphis stop #4.

Start Up Culture
----------------
Nashville appears to have the most momentum in the state for establishing
a start up scene. But there are some interesting pieces to technology start
ups in Memphis as well. `Start Up Memphis <http://startupmemphis.com/>`_ has
interesting, up to date articles on companies in the area. 
`Launchpad Memphis <http://www.launchmemphis.com/launchpad/>`_ is a coworking
space for start ups and hosts some of the 
`Memphis Python (MemPy) <http://mempy.org/>`_ meet ups.

However, it's been difficult finding out exactly what start ups are in
Memphis, particularly ones using Python. More digging is necessary in this
area.

Venture Capital
---------------
* `SSM Ventures <http://www.ssmventures.com/>`_. Wide range of investments
  in software companies and healthcare.
* `MD Venture Partners <http://www.mbventures.com/>`_. Specific to the life
  sciences industry, particularly treatments and cures for musculoskeletal 
  diseases.

Further Research
----------------
My further research on Memphis will be posted on the 
`Memphis destination page <../memphis-tn.html>`_.
