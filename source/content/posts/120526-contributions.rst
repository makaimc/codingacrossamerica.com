The Coding Across America 
`contributors page <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/contributors.html>`_
is a list of everyone that has in some way given me advice, recommendations, 
or in some way shaped my trip.

The four month journey I am starting in March is much too large to have
planned and figured out just by myself. I want to recognize everyone from
behind the scenes that make the trip happen. In addition, just having
a list of names isn't interesting nor does it do justice to the people who've
taken the time to help me out. Therefore every name has a link to something
amazing that person has done.

For example, Ryan Anderson, who I graduated with from JMU in 2005, took a picture
that became the cover of Science magazine in December 2010. That's an amazing
accomplishment. I hope that going through the list of contributors is a
fascinating look into the lives of people who helped make Coding Across America
possible.
