`4.0 Schools <http://4pt0.org/>`_ in New Orleans is a design lab for
startups and innovators working to transform education. I have been hanging 
out around the 4.0 Schools office throughout the
week during `IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_'s 
New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week (NOEW).
Part of my time here was spent meeting with local startups, some of whom
`pitched yesterday at NOEW <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/noew-4pt0-schools-companies-pitches.html>`_, 
learning about the local tech scene, and writing about the
enthusastic building of an entreprenurial culture here in New Orleans. 

I also needed a home base to to do a bunch of tech work for my clients back 
in DC. Luckily, the founder of 4.0 Schools, 
`Matt Candler <https://twitter.com/mcandler>`_, allowed me free use of their
space and wifi throughout my time here.

If you're a developer passing through New Orleans, shoot an email or tweet
@mcandler. He's opening up his space and couch to us developers in exchange
for the occasional answer to a technical question. In addition, you can find
