A Few Route Modifications
=========================

I'm making a few changes to my planned route (which is now reflected in
the embedded Google Map on the about page). These modifications are due to
conversations I've recently had with several people familiar with these
cities. I decided that based on their recommendations I would be missing out
if I did not visit these destinations.

Since I am in the researching and planning phase, it's still easy to make
changes without completely throwing off my entire schedule.

Additions
---------
1. **New Orleans, LA**

`Burton White <http://excella.com/people/burton-white.aspx>`_, one of the
founding partners at the firm Excella Consulting where I work is originally 
from New Orleans. He said that there have been some interesting 
developments in the state around small businesses and tech start ups. Plus,
I'm excited to get a chance to have a beer and code in the French 
Quarter during a nice day again.

2. **San Diego, CA**

My brother Luke was in San Diego in July and said I definitely need to go
here and at least visit for a couple of days.

3. **Madison, WI**

Several people recommended Madison as a stop that would go well with what
I am looking to do on my trip. I've never been here before but it seems like
an interesting college town that I'd enjoy visiting.

Subtractions
------------
1. **Dallas, TX**

The addition of New Orleans took me further South than I originally thought
I would go. Dallas was previously a good stop between Nashville and Austin,
but now it would be out of the way between New Orleans and Austin. Besides,
by removing Dallas I get to spend more time in Austin.
