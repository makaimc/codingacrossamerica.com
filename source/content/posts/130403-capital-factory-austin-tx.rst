Capital Factory started in January 2009 and has been at the forefront of
Austin's momentum as Texas' startup hub. The incubation space is located
downtown on the top floor of the Austin Centre building. The top floor spot
provides some amazing views of the surrounding Austin downtown.

A couple well known startups such as `WPEngine <http://wpengine.com/>`_,
`Return Path <http://www.returnpath.com/>`_, 
and `Taskbox <http://taskbox.co/>`_ are in residence with as many as thirty
employees.

The space is stocked with snacks, drinks, and even a couple of kegerators
with good beers on tap. The food availability alone is worth the price of 
admission for starving startup founders.

The space also serves as a hub for tech and entrepreneurship meetups. There
are usually at least one if not two meetups going on at the same thing every
weekday evening. Many people involved in startups in Austin are either working
here or are at events in the evenings. The constant traffic of entrepreneurs 
and bright technical minds helps form serendipitous connections among 
disaparate members of the Austin community.
