Hiking in Colorado was amazing - and tiring. It's tough on your lungs to
go from about 5,000 feet elevation to 12,000+ feet within a 40 minute drive,
then climb up a steep hill to go even higher. Still this trip was well
worth the effort due to the amazing scenery at that level. Once again the
pictures don't do it justice compared to being there in person but they
still turned out reasonably well.
