Why Los Alamos, New Mexico?

Los Alamos, New Mexico is another one of those destinations that leaves
people wondering "what does that have to do with tech"? It is definitely
not a town that people associate with startups like Palo Alto, Seattle, 
Boulder, or Austin. Still there is a lot of advanced research going on here
although it's not well publicized outside of academic circles. Some of the
work is classified as well. Despite my Top Secret security clearance,
I'm unfortunately not going to get to see the cool classified work going 
on in 
`Los Alamos National Laboratory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory>`_.

It's likely most of my time here will be spent outdoors or in small town
getting some solid coding time in.

I'll `post further notes <../los-alamos-nm.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about Los Alamos.
