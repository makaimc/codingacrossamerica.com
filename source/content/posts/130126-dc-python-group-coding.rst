Washington, DC is most commonly associated with politics but it has
quite a technology scene as well. I'm taking advantage of as many of the
events I can attend before hitting the road in March. Today is DC Python's
group coding session at `SocialCode <http://www.socialcode.com/>`_.

Developers are working on projects such as scientific and numeric analysis
with NumPy and SciPy, geographic information systems, a Jenkins-based
software-as-a-service platform that runs off Amazon Web Services, new
Python commandline tools, and some 
`PyGame <http://www.pygame.org/news.html>`_ projects.

I did writing on the web frameworks section of 
`Full Stack Python <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`_.

Here are some pictures from the event.
