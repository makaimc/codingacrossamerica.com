Why Redding, CA?
================

Redding is a small town of about 90k residents in Northern California,
about three and a half hours from San Francisco. From my initial research
there doesn't seem to be much of a technology start up scene here. That's
fine - this is another destination where I can spend some time programming
and writing without interruptions. 

Redding looks like a beautiful city (I've never been there before) and I'll
need a break after the gauntlet of San Diego-LA-San Francisco. Redding and
Eugene, Oregon provide a week respite before diving back into the startup
scenes of Portland and Seattle.

I'll `post further notes <../redding-ca.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about Redding.
