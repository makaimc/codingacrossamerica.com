A Month of Meeting Startups
===========================

I have been on the road for one month meeting with startups, software 
developers, and organizations dedicated to creating a greater entrepreneurial
ecosystem in the United States. 

Twenty percent of my time and cities are behind me. I have driven just over 
2600 miles of my projected 10k+ miles according to my aggregated daily mileage 
totals. This post contains my initial thoughts and paints some broad 
themes from what I've seen firsthand so far.

During my time in DC, Charlottesville, Charlotte, New Orleans, Memphis,
Dallas, and Austin I've met with sixteen organizations (see the
`"Who Have You Already Met With?" <../to-prospective-organizations.html>`_  
section) in addition to attending many meetups and hanging out with 
individual software developers.

Here are three themes consistently appearing so far:

1. Startup communities are generous and open

2. Intercity connections are ad hoc and arbitrary

3. Startup entrepreneurship is a long way from being a "normal" thing to do


Startup Community Generosity
----------------------------
The startup communities for most of my destinations, particularly New Orleans,
Memphis, Dallas, and Austin, have been very generous and open about their
cities. 

I'm amazed by the amount of time that startups, accelerators, 
incubators, co-working spaces, and independent developers have been 
willing to spend with me. We talk for hours about not only their own 
ventures but their cities in general. Everyone has also been extremely 
forthcoming about what weaknesses they perceive in their respective 
locations.

There *are* weaknesses to each location. Only by being open about them and
learning from what other cities are doing well can we hope to improve. 
I will lay out in detail both the strengths and weaknesses in a future post.


Intercity Connections
---------------------
Connections between entrepreneurs and software developers between cities
are ad hoc and arbitrary. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge sharing
that could benefit entrepreneurs and developers that is not currently taking
place.

There's an opportunity here to do a better job of connecting entrepreneurs,
and those running accelerators, incubators, and co-working spaces with
their counterparts in other cities. Part of the lack of intercity 
connections are being addressed by `Startup America <http://www.s.co/>`_ and 
its `regional champions and summits <http://www.s.co/about/champions>`_.

Publications like `Nibletz <http://nibletz.com/>`_ and 
`Tech Cocktail <http://tech.co/>`_ will help to spread knowledge. As will
books such as `Startup Communities <http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem-ebook/dp/B008UV826U/ref=tmm_kin_title_0>`_
by Brad Feld.

Conferences that work to be inclusive of other communities like the
`Everywhere Else Conference <http://upstart.bizjournals.com/companies/startups/2013/01/17/nibletz-launches-everywhere-else-con.html?page=all>`_ 
(organized by Nibletz) will allow organizers in each city to connect.


Entrepreneurship Normalcy
-------------------------
Entrepreneurship, even in the technology industry, is a long way from being
the "normal" thing to do. We have a long uphill climb before a majority of 
software developers, designers, marketers, and others start their own 
companies or join early stage ventures.

I do not yet know how to make entrepreneurship open to a larger audience
without dumbing it down. The answer may lie in education. 

We must educate a wider audience show entrepreneurship is not born through 
crazy ideas that go off in the mind of brilliant, but rare individuals. 
Instead, entrepreneurship is a difficult but repeatable process. A process 
of solving other people's problems by listening to them and meeting their 
needs while working within your own vision.

Stripping the mystery from entrepreneurship while reinforcing the 
understanding that is a long, difficult road may help to make it "normal"
to a wider audience.


Highs and Lows on the Road
--------------------------
I am often asked "what's been your favorite part of your trip?" 
I can't pick one specific high. In no particular order, my New Orleans 
favorite was working with the
`MBA teams <../noew-ideacorps-pitch-challenge.html>`_ at 
New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week, as well as and hanging around the 
`IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_ and 
`4.0 Schools <http://4pt0.org/>`_ spaces. My Memphis favorite was spending 
my first time in the city going out to dinner and drinks with
`Seed Hatchery <http://www.seedhatchery.com/>`_. Speaking to a great group
at `MemPy <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_ and talking to 
`Work for Pie <https://workforpie.com/>`_ is up there as well. 
Austin was just beyond any expectations for what I was hoping for. The
time I spent at `Continuum Analytics <http://continuum.io/>`_, 
`CopperEgg <http://copperegg.com/>`_, 
`OpenCoffee <http://opencoffeeaustin.org/>`_, 
`Capital Factory <http://capitalfactory.com/>`_ (blog posts for these coming
soon) was fascinating. No one Austin is 
`getting Google Fiber <http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/09/google-fiber-rollout-detailed-for-austin-due-mid-2014/>`_.

The biggest low so far was driving out of Austin on Sunday afternoon. That 
was a difficult day. But I made it to Lubbock and now I've had some time
to reflect on my previous six cities. It's wild to think I have another
four months of this ahead of me.

Let me know what topics I should elaborate on further or if you're 
interested in meeting up in any of the 23 cities I'm traveling to next.
