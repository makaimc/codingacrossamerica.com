I have been on the road for one month today. Twenty percent of my time and
cities are behind me. Now is a good time to give my initial thoughts.

I can't pick one specific high. In no particular order, one high was 
New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week was amazing, including working with the 
`MBA teams <../noew-ideacorps-pitch-challenge.html>`_ 
and hanging around the IdeaVillage and 4.0 Schools spaces. 

Three main themes are consistenly popping up so far. 

1. Generosity and openness of software developers, entrepreneurs, community
   builders in each city

2. Ad hoc intercity connections

3. Lack of normalcy of startup entrepreneurship
