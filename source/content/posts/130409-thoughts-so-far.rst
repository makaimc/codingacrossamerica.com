I have been on the road for one month today. Twenty percent of my time and
cities are behind me. I have driven just over 2600 miles according to my
aggregated daily mileage totals. Now is a good time to jot down my initial 
thoughts and paint some broad themes from what I've seen firsthand.

But first, I am often asked "what's been your favorite part of your trip?" 
I can't pick one specific high. In no particular order, my New Orleans 
favorite was working with the
`MBA teams <../noew-ideacorps-pitch-challenge.html>`_ at 
New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week, as well as and hanging around the 
`IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_ and 
`4.0 Schools <http://4pt0.org/>`_ spaces. My Memphis favorite was spending 
my first time in the city going out to dinner and drinks with
`Seed Hatchery <http://www.seedhatchery.com/>`_. Speaking to a great group
at `MemPy <http://mempy.org/march-25-2013.html>`_ and talking to 
`Work for Pie <https://workforpie.com/>`_ is up there as well. 
Austin was just beyond any expectations for what I was hoping for. I loved
every minute I was in that city.

The biggest low so far was driving out of Austin on Sunday afternoon. That 
was a difficult day. But I made it to Lubbock and now I've had some time
to reflect on my previous six cities.

Here are three themes consistenly appearing so far:

1. Startup communities are generous and open

2. Intercity connections are ad hoc and arbitrary

3. Startup entrepreneurship is a long way from being a "normal" thing to do


Startup Community Generosity
----------------------------
The startup communities for most of my destinations, particularly New Orleans,
Memphis, Dallas, and Austin, have been very generous and open about their
cities. I'm amazed by the amount of time startups, accelerators, incubators,
co-working spaces, and independent developers have been willing to spend with
me to explain not only their own ventures but their cities in general.
Everyone has also been extremely forthcoming about what weaknesses they
perceive in their respective locations.


Intercity Connections
---------------------
Connections between entrepreneurs and software developers between cities
are ad hoc and arbitrary. There is a tremendous amount of knowledge sharing
that could benefit entrepreneurs and developers that is not currently taking
place.


Entrepreneurship Normalcy
-------------------------
Entrepreneurship, even in the technology industry, is a long way from being
the "normal" thing to do. We have a long uphill climb before a majority of 
software developers start their own companies or join early stage ventures.
