The drive from Phoenix to San Diego.

----

In San Diego I will be attending the San Diego Python Users Group 
`April meetup <http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/107826712/>`_ and
meet with local startups and co-working spaces.

Phoenix is destination number eleven of thirty for Coding Across America.
