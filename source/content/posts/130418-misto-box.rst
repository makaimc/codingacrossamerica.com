MistoBox started as a University of Arizona Entrepreneurship Program project 
during the founders' senior years. The founders, Samantha Meis and Connor
Riley, launched a successful 
`Kickstarter project <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mistobox/mistobox-delivering-delicious-micro-roasted-coffee>`_ 
in 2012 to obtain the initial funding for their business. Upon 
graduation, Samantha and Connor had to make a decision whether to get 
plain old jobs or continue building their business. 

Sam and Connor fortunately chose to carry MistoBox forward. In fact, they
just hired their first employee.

MistoBox works out of the "warehouse district" area of downtown Phoenix.
Their offices are right next to another Phoenix startup, 
`WebPT <http://www.webpt.com/>`_, and a short walk from the DiamondBacks 
stadium.

Samantha gave a quick introduction to MistoBox on the final morning of
the Startup America Regional Summit. Everyone in the room was impressed
by what Samantha and Connor have already accomplished. It's hard not to
cheer for these guys. They are a great part of the small but thriving 
entrepreneurial culture in Phoenix.
