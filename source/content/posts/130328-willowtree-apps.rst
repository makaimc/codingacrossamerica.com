There are over
`800,000 apps <http://ipod.about.com/od/iphonesoftwareterms/qt/apps-in-app-store.htm>`_
in both Apple's iOS store and Google's Play store. 

If you want to build a mobile app, why would you pay a development team 
significant money to create it? Surely you can hire a smart teenager down 
the block to "build it for a few hundred bucks," right?

Or maybe you can build the app yourself. How hard can mobile app development 
be when there are ways to create
`apps without coding <http://blog.laptopmag.com/ios-android-app-without-coding-appmachine>`_?

Hold on. Software development is **hard**. There is 
`no silver bullet <http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~xswang/Research/Papers/SERelated/no-silver-bullet.pdf>`_ 
for translating the ideas in your head into quality software that people 
want to use. The key word here is *quality*. 

Mobile apps are a particularly difficult type of software to
develop because apps require many parts. Some parts run on your phone while
others are housed in distant computing centers that your phone accesses over 
its data connection.  Most of the time a user is completely unaware of the 
interactions between these myriad technologies.

It's possible to throw together a mobile app with pre-built tools or by 
hiring someone on the cheap. But the poor results can frustrate your users 
and damage your brand. 

Creating a cohesive user experience requires tight interaction between 
programmers, designers, and the person or group with the ideas for the 
mobile app. Firms that specialize in mobile app development bring together 
software developers with expertise in mobile platforms, such as Android 
and iOS, designers who specialize in creating mobile app user experiences, 
and facilitators who can translate customers' abstract ideas into concrete 
details.

`WillowTree Apps <http://www.willowtreeapps.com/>`_ builds mobile apps for 
organizations that know a poor mobile experience for their customers is 
unacceptable. The Charlottesville, Virginia-based company has built the 
Android and iOS mobile apps for well-known organizations such as the 
`Brooklyn Nets <http://www.nba.com/nets/nets-official-mobile-app>`__,
`The Verge <http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/17/3164899/the-verge-app-now-available-for-android-and-ios>`_,
`The University of Virginia <http://www.virginia.edu/mobile/>`_,
and, as much as it pains me to say this, 
the 
`Philadelphia Eagles <http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/fanzone/mobile.html>`_ 
(I'm a NY Giants fan). 

WillowTree Apps is also branching out into development for embedded systems, 
which is based on the recent incorporation of Android into computing areas
typically dominated by low-level and proprietary programming languages.

During our conversation in their office and over a Thai food lunch, something
became apparent to me as I asked questions based on my software development
knowledge: these guys are passionate about iOS and Android 
development like I'm passionate about Python development. Understanding the
nuances of these platforms requires developers to have a passion for learning
outside a 9-5 job. That passion for building on mobile platforms combined 
with designers equally passionate about user experience is a valuable 
combination. 

The development team is split between iOS-focused developers who program
in Objective-C and Android-focused developers who program in Java. Designers
work with each team interchangeably.


Software Development in Charlottesville

Recruiting software developers in Charlottesville can be difficult because
it is not a major metropolitan area. Washington, DC is the closest major
city and Richmond, Virginia is about an hour away. 

There are some advantages to Charlottesville though. First, WillowTree Apps'
office on the Downtown Mall is about a mile away from The University of 
Virginia. Charlottesville is an attractive city to live after graduation or 
to return to when raising a family. The Downtown Mall is a hub of great
restaurants, outdoor concerts, and eclectic independent stores.

WillowTree Apps also runs a local tech meetup for mobile app designers and
developers called `ChoMobile <http://www.meetup.com/cho-mobile/>`_ to foster
tech relationships in Charlottesville.

Charlottesville is a city of about 43,000 people. Yet here's a company 
building high quality mobile apps for some of the biggest organizations
and sports franchises in the United States. That's a testament to the amount
of interesting technology work going on everywhere in the US.
