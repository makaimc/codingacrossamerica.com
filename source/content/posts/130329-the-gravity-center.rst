(`@gravity_centre <https://twitter.com/gravity_centre>`_) 
in Plano, Texas is an early stage incubator funded by Alcatel-Lucent 
and supported by corporate innovation programs AT&T Foundry and ng Connect.
The incubator's space north of Dallas provides entrepreneurs 
who live in Plano with an attractive local alternative to obtaining an 
office downtown (known as "Uptown" in Dallas).

Entrepreneurship in Plano
-------------------------
The two most precious resources for startup companies are time and money.
Time is always scarce. Spending hours stuck in Dallas traffic every day 
driving to and from the office is a "luxury" that founders cannot afford.
For founders who already live in Plano they can eliminate wasted hours
traveling to and from downtown Dallas by working in Plano.

The Gravity Center also provides indirect help on the monetary side by 
providing free office space and resources to accepted startups. AT&T and
Alcatel-Lucent also evaluate startups in the space for investment or funding
through contracts to build products.
