Latest Technologies
-------------------
Andrew is currently working on the continuous deployment pipeline at
the `Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <http://www.consumerfinance.gov/>`_ 
(CFPB). Significant technical debt accrued in CFPB's technical 
infrastructure over the past several years while standing up the agency. 
Reducing that debt and enabling future projects to deliver faster are 
the main goals for Andrew's most recent work.

Developers at CFPB are using several tools to figure out where the technical 
debt is located in their code and the development process. The CFPB team
has `Jenkins continuous integration <http://jenkins-ci.org/>`_ set up to 
constantly check syntax with `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_,
perform static code analysis with `pylint <http://www.pylint.org/>`_, and 
determine code complexity with `radon <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/radon>`_.
Andrew and the rest of the the team can then use the output of those tools to
determine where to spend their efforts 
`refactoring <http://www.refactoring.com/>`_ the code to reduce the debt.

Docker
------
Andrew says he's recently had a lot of fun playing with 
`Docker <http://www.dockerio.com/>`_ on side projects. He found out about 
Docker through a 
`talk he saw at DjangoCon <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q9YlJV-wgQ>`_ 
given by 
`Ken Cochran <http://kencochrane.net/index.html>`_ 
(`@KenCochrane <https://twitter.com/KenCochrane>`_). From there Andrew went
through the Docker 
`"Getting Started" tutorial <http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/>`_ and 
`Python examples <http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/python_web_app/>`_
to get his own hands on experience with the software.

While there are still a few rough edges the software holds a lot of 
potential for opening up programmatic manipulation of lightweight 
virtualization to mainstream developers.


Learning to Program
-------------------
While at the University of Virginia (UVA), Andrew double majored in Computer 
Science and Foreign Affairs. He also served as Editor-in-Chief of 
`The Cavalier Daily <http://www.cavalierdaily.com/>`_, UVA's award-winning 
student-run newspaper. It was at The Cavalier Daily that Andrew was first
exposed to `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, which at the time
ran the newspaper's website (it was later migrated to a different tech stack).

After college Andrew worked for 
`Accenture <http://www.accenture.com/us-en/pages/index.aspx>`_ 
programming Java and SQL applications. That experience combined with his
Computer Science degree from UVA allowed him to be successful programming
with Python after moving to Excella Consulting. He now works with the Python
stack full time as well as with side projects such as his
`technical blog <http://www.andrewtorkbaker.com/>`_.


CFPB's eRegulations and Regulations Parser
------------------------------------------
A quick plug for a couple of open source projects from CFPB: 
`eRegulations <http://eregs.github.io/eregulations/>`_ and the
`regulations parser <https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser>`_. While
Andrew only indirectly supported these projects at CFPB he's been very
impressed by the interest from the broader open source community so far. 
Great job by 
`Shashank Khandelwal <http://skhandelwal.com/>`_ 
and `C.M. Lubinski <http://cmlubinski.info/>`_ for their programming and
their roles engaging with the broader open source community.
