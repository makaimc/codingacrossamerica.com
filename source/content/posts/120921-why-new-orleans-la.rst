Why New Orleans, Louisana?
==========================

New Orleans has a strong, unique city culture. I previously traveled to 
New Orleans in 2010 although I was there for only a few short days. I have 
a couple of reasons for returning and making New Orleans the fifth destination
on my trip.

First, one of the `Excella Consulting <http://www.excella.com/>`_ founding
partners, Burton White, is from 
New Orleans. He told me about some of the most recent efforts by the state
to create tax breaks for innovative companies to start and come to the area.
I'm interested to see if that type of local government involved has positively
impacted the area.

Second, I only had a few days to explore the French Quarter during the day
and at night. My experience in the city is really limited. I want to expand
my view of the city into other parts such as St. Charles Ave. The combination
of gaining further insight into the technology of the city plus the 
interesting destinations in the area are an appealing mix.

Late March Weather

previously here in February and the weather was great (high 70s).
