I lived in Charlottesville, VA from 2007-09. Charlottesville's distance 
between DC and Charlotte makes it a good spot to spend a couple of days before 
heading South. Charlottesville is one of those small towns that really grows 
on you. Most UVA grads have a high opinion of Cville as a great location
to be both during and after school.

Starting in Charlottesville will give me a couple of days to start my trip
on the right foot. I can talk to some new people, take a lot of pictures,
and make sure I'm really ready to hit the road.
