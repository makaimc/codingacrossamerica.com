Why Charlottesville, VA?
========================

Originally my first stop was Charlotte, NC. Now it's stop #2. I used to live 
in Charlottesville, VA from 2007-09. Charlottesville's distance between DC 
and Charlotte makes it a good spot to spend a couple of days before 
heading out to new destinations. Charlottesville is one of those small 
towns that really grows on you. Given a solid financial situation, I'd 
love to have a weekend house here one day that is walking distance to the 
Downtown Mall. I'm sure if you polled most University of Virginia 
grads they'd say the same.

Starting in Charlottesville will give me a couple of days to start my trip
on the right foot. I can talk to some new people, take a lot of pictures,
and make sure I'm really ready to hit the road.

Start Up Culture
----------------
Charlottesville is a small city (~45k residents) and the home of 
`University of Virginia <http://www.virginia.edu/>`_. Its small size
belies its close knit tech scene. There are a mix of small consulting
firms servicing the local National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) and
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) market, but also some product-based
companies as well.

* `Open Space <http://getopenspace.com/>`_ is a really interesting 
  collaboration space for individuals and small businesses that need a
  place to work. They also host events where speakers will come for an
  evening and talk about relevant topics.

* `Batten Institute for Entrepreneurship (Darden School of Business) <http://www.darden.virginia.edu/web/batten-institute/>`_ studies innovation and
  entrepreneurship from an academic standpoint.

* `Court Square Ventures <http://courtsquareventures.com/>`_ is a venture
  capital firm based in Charlottesville. Needs further research.

* `Tall Oaks Capital <http://www.talloakscapital.com/>`_ is another VC firm.

Charlottesville has quite a few venture capital firms and hedge funds in the
area. I'm guessing this is because many UVA grads do well on Wall Street
then come back to Charlottesville to settle down.

Interesting Notes
-----------------
* `Alexis Ohanian <http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478>`_, a Reddit co-founder, went to UVA and graduated
  in 2005.

Coffee Shops
------------
Charlottesville has some great spots to sit and code:

* `Shenandoah Joe Coffee Roaster <http://www.shenandoahjoe.com/>`_ 
  on Preston Ave. I've been here before and I love the place.
* `Mudhouse <http://www.mudhouse.com/>`_ on the Downtown Mall. Again, I've
  been to this spot and its location on the Downtown Mall is perfect.
* `Para Coffee <http://www.paracoffee.com/>`_ on The Corner (near Grounds).
* `Lataza Coffee House <http://latazacoffeehouse.com/>`_ in Belmont.
* `Greenberry's <http://www.greenberrys.com/locations.php>`_ - a chain, but
  I really like their location at Barrack's Road Shopping Center.

March Weather
-------------
March weather in Charlottesville is generally cold, but it varies from 
day-to-day. I may have to be careful driving or change some plans if any 
snow hits.
