Why Charlotte, North Carolina?
==============================

Charlotte, North Carolina is the first destination on my trip outside of
Washington, DC. Charlotte is approximately 400 miles from DC (about 7 hours)
and several people I know have moved to Charlotte to escape the 
government-centric DC area for careers focused on commercial business.
Charlotte is also the largest city in North Carolina, and the second largest 
banking center in the US. This is a summary of my pre-research reasons 
for why I'm traveling to Charlotte.

Reality Check
-------------
I read a lot of `Hacker News <http://news.ycombinator.com/>`_ which biases
my opinions towards small start ups and against large firms. Charlotte may
provide a grounding in what many US cities consider technology to be useful
for. Tech can be a support function for an industries that were around long
before the term "computer" was used to describe a machine.

Start Up Culture
----------------
I am unaware in my limited knowledge of any start up companies coming out
of North Carolina. Is there a culture there that support risk-taking? If
you try to start a venture or join a small company that fails, is there a
stigma attached to that failure?

The Financial Industry
----------------------
It appears that the financial industry heavily impacts the tech culture in
Charlotte. Financial institutions are notoriously large, bureaucratic
organizations with many policies, procedures, and controls in place designed
(but not always successful) for protecting customers' investments. How does
that impact the tech scene in Charlotte, NC?

March Weather
-------------
Weather in mid-March is a secondary consideration since Charlotte is 
my first destination. I plan to reach Charlotte by late in the day on
March 12, 2013.

Research
--------
My further research on Charlotte will be posted on the 
`Charlotte destination page <../charlotte-nc.html>`_.
