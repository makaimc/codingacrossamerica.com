Why San Francisco, CA?

Why not San Francisco? Technically this stop is a combination of 
the areas in and around San Francisco, Palo Alto, and San Jose. There are
so many interesting start ups, venture capital firms, and technology
meetups it's difficult to know where to start.

I've never been to San Francisco (or CA before this trip). These will
be ten very busy days talking to companies, other software developers,
and going to tech meetups, as well as exploring the area.

Start Up Culture
----------------
Where do I begin? I want to visit both well-known technology companies
such as Facebook and Github as well as smaller companies that are not
yet tech mainstream names.


More Research
-------------
I'll `post further notes <../san-francisco-ca.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about San Francisco.
