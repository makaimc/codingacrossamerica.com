I've spent the past few days in Los Alamos, New Mexico (population 12k) and 
before that Lubbock, Texas (pop. 234k, 83rd in the country for cities). I'm
spending the weekend in Moab, Utah (pop. 5k) before driving to sunny 
Phoenix, Arizona.

Suprisingly, the most common reaction with regards to smaller cities is 
"why the hell are you going *there*"? I found that reaction surprising enough
that I wanted to write my thoughts on the topic.


Why...
------
Yes, I know I've sold this entire trip as meeting with software developers,
startups, and entrepreneurs across the United States, and then writing about 
what's going on. But there's a couple of really good reasons to look
up from my computer screen every once in awhile (I know that statement may
come as a surprise to some of my colleagues. See, I *am* learning).

What's Normal?
--------------
What is normal in life is driven by the people and environment you surround 
yourself with. We're all *social creatures* influenced by social norms. In 
some cultures you are successful if you get a job at a big company, sign 
your life away, and work 80+ hours a week (hello Japan and much of 
corporate America). In that type of culture you're going to have a very 
difficult path ahead of you before you even launch your business.

Why does that matter? Well, it would be damn easy for me to do the opposite.
I could surround myself only with entrepreneurs for five months and fool 
myself into thinking this is the only way people think in our country. In
reality, the entrepreneurial population is still a minority compared to 
the majority of people who work an hourly or salaried job.

Besides, as `Steve Blank <http://steveblank.com/>`_ says, you need to get
out of the building. We can't all be entrepreneurs just solving each others
entrepreneurship-related problems. Seeing different snapshots from a range
of cities clearly shows that what's normal is context dependent.


Roadtrip Reflections
--------------------
There are also some amazing things to see in America.

It's a road trip. I don't want to miss awesome views like this one.

Stopping in a few out of the way places helps me reflect, try to catch up
on my writing (yes, I know, I'm way way behind), take in the sights, and 
program ideas that are bouncing around in my head.
