In July 2010, Marcus Wandell (`@antceo <https://twitter.com/antceo>`_) and 
Hunter Jensen launched their mobile app called "Anttenna." They relaunched and
rebranded to Antengo a few months later in September 2010.

Antengo is a mobile-first company, meaning they design and implement their
product to have a full experience on a mobile phone through their app. Some
alternative products, such as Craigslist, were originally designed for the
web and are therefore less convenient to use on mobile phones.


Technology
----------
`Antengo <http://antengo.com/>`_ has native apps for both 
`iOS <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/antengo-classifieds-auto-post/id355980778?mt=8>`_ 
and `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antengo.activities&hl=en>`_.

The backend services running on remote servers that store data and interact 
with the mobile apps are built in PHP.

Team

In 2010, Marcus Wendell discussed his idea for a mobile-first classified ads
startup with Hunter Jensen, founder of 
`Barefoot Solutions <http://www.barefootsolutions.com/>`_. Hunter had
prior interest in classified ad services having worked on 
`ULoop <http://www.uloop.com/>`_ and 
`Barefoot Student <http://www.barefootstudent.com/>`_. He agreed to
help Marcus build the app that became Antengo in exchange for equity.

Antengo is one of several companies based out of the EvoNexus incubator 
in downtown San Diego, which is partially funded by the city. It's great to
see free office space offered to qualifying startups since their capital is
limited and should primarily be spent on building a great team.
