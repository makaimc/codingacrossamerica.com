Hey PyCon!

My friend `Andrew Baker <http://www.excella.com/careers/college-profiles/andrew-baker.aspx>`_ 
was awesome enough to present a `lightning talk <http://www.mattmakai.com/static/presentations/pycon-andrew-baker.html>`_
on Coding Across America this morning.

If you're a software developer or organization in one of the 
`thirty cities <../cities.html>`_ I'm planning to visit, please contact me
at matthew.makai@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you, either to meet up
or just to find out more about what you love and hate about working in
software in your city.

I also write feature posts on organizations solving interesting problems with
software. `HumanGeo <../human-geo-washington-dc.html>`_ and 
`WiserTogether <../wisertogether-washington-dc.html>`_ are a couple of 
examples. Uppidy, AgilityFeat, and WillowTree Apps will be up in the next
few days once I finish those posts.

If you're a prospective organization and would like to meet, I wrote an FAQ
`specifically to answer some of the initial questions <../to-prospective-organizations.html>`_ 
that might come up on your side. After you read through that, shoot me an
email at matthew.makai@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
