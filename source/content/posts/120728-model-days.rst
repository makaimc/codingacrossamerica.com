Archetypal Days

There are several archetypal days I'll have over the course of four 
months on the road. Some types of days are more conducive than others
for coding.

I need large blocks of time since it's difficult to context switch
while deep diving into difficult problems while programming. Focused 
time just won't happen if I only have an hour here, 15 minutes there, 
to work. See Paul Graham's essay 
`Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule <http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html>`_ for the clearest explanation of why large blocks of uninterrupted
time are so critical in software development. Some days that won't
be possible, so I'll just keep that in mind as I'm planning what to do.

Below is a list of archetypical days will look like over the course of 
my trip.

1. **Travel days**

*8am to 10am.*
Run or workout. Shower, get dressed, have something to eat.

*10am to anywhere from 3pm to 8pm.*
Hit the open road. I've spaced out the driving time between cities to 
five to ten hours at most. Ten hours of driving by myself won't be much
fun but it's still manageable within a single day.

*Late afternoon to evening.*
Arrive at destination. Check in or meet up with a friend. Explore 
surroundings to get my bearings. Get to bed early after a long day of
travel.

2. **Coding days**

*7am to 830-9am.*
Run or workout. Shower, get dressed, have something to eat.

*9am through the evening.*
Find a coffee shop, library, cool restaurant, bar (or several of them
to move throughout the day). Code! Eat when hungry. Walk when I need a break or to stretch out.

3. **Meeting days**

Meeting days I plan to break into two chunks - one in the morning, one in
the late afternoon. That way I have two large blocks of time. I can use
one or both chunks to meet with people, code, or explore the city.

*Morning*
Meet up with a start up team, software developer, or someone involved in
a city's local entrepreneurship scene and find out what they're working on
and what makes their city unique.

*Evening*
Same as the morning or use the time for writing blog posts on what I learned
that morning or to do programming.

4. **Tourist days**

*830am to 11am.*
Run or workout. Shower, get dressed, have something to eat.

*11am through the evening.*
Explore the city, take pictures, and write blog posts.
