Eight MBA teams worked with local entrepreneurs during New Orleans 
Entrepreneurship Week. The teams were advised by employees from Google,
Salesforce, Silverline, and Excella Consulting on subjects where they had 
gaps in experience, such as developing software platform roadmaps. Overall 
though it was the teams' extensive work throughout the week that created 
value for the entrepreneurs. This morning was a chance for each of the 
schools to pitch the entrepreneurs' ideas to a panel of judges from 
venture capital firms. 

The schools and the companies they represented, in order they pitched, were:

1. Tulane - eTax Credit Exchange
2. Harvard - Gotointerview.com
3. Columbia - Zlien
4. Cornell - Bissap Breeze
5. Dartmouth - Clothes Line
6. Loyola - Pierce Industries
7. Stanford - Education Everytime
8. Yale - Your Nutrition Delivered

Sara Thomas and Tim Williamson of IdeaVillage provided an introduction.

Tulane University
-----------------
eTax Credit Exchange is an anonymous online marketplace for buying and selling 
tax credits. The tax credit exchanges can occur both within a single state 
and across multiple states. eTax Credit Exchange hopes to bring liquidity to
the tax credit market which is currently underused by organizations that can
benefit from the credits.

Harvard University
------------------
Gotointerview.com is an online platform with pre-recorded videos of job 
seeking candidates for prospective employers. The Harvard Business School
team posited and tested hypotheses about the pain employers and prospective
employees feel. The team then determined how Gotointerview.com could 
position itself to best solve the problems around hiring hourly employees.

The revenue model is based on charging employers a fee when job candidates

based on growth of the platform.

Columbia University
-------------------
Zlien helps construction contractors get paid through mechanics liens through
a simplified online platform. Each state has different regulations for
mechanics liens so Zlien eliminates the necessity for contractors to involve
lawyers in the process.

Cornell University
------------------
Bissap Breeze is a traditional African drink called Hibiscus that Bissap 
produces in the United States to sell locally. The company had early success 
with Whole Foods and Rousses. Unfortunately, Bissap then found itself with 
unsold inventory from premature scaling, which created monthly losses. The 
Cornell team helped stablize Bissap's finances and put in place structure 
for accurate accounting going forward.

Dartmouth University
--------------------
Clothes Line has a software product for retail trade show product orders.
Currently purchases at retail trade shows is done entirely by paper. The
current process is error prone. The order amounts written can be incorrect.
There can be insufficient product by vendors to fulfill orders. Clothes Line
software creates virtual purchase orders that can be processed more 
efficiently than paper-based purchase orders.

Clothes Line name. The revenue model is based on charging vendors a 
percentage fee based on each transaction conducted through the software.

from waves that can be used to rebuild shorelines. Wave Robber works through
the energy of the waves and does not require an external power source. Many
modular Wave Robbers can be placed and hooked together to cover a large
area of shoreline.

Yale University
---------------
Your Nutrition Delivered is a service for healthy home delivery of meals to 
customers. The founder has a background in nutrition and uses that as a 
differentiator over competing services that are "pseudo-healthy."

The core customers for the business are busy professionals who do not have
time to cook as well as overweight individuals do not have enough knowledge
about what is healthy to lose weight. The core business service is provided
through home delivery and a catering service, instead of vending machines.
The service is positioned as a high-end differentiated service instead of
a low cost model.

IdeaPitch competition.
