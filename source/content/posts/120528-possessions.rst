“Many wealthy people are little more than the janitors of their possessions.” 
- Frank Lloyd Wright

Several years ago I decided see if I could eventually
fit all my possessions in `my car <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_S2000>`_.
Until recently, this goal seemed like an impossible task. Look at how small that 
trunk is. The car has no back seat! I also had quite the volume of stuff: couches, 
a desktop computer, hundreds of books, a bed, a desk, and a 
closet full of clothes. But I've slowly pared down my possessions after moving 
nine times in the last seven years.

When I leave in March, I will get rid of the last two pieces of furniture I
own: a bed and a desk. Both are on their last legs so I am not concerned with
giving them away or trashing them. I read and gave away most of my books (I have
about three dozen currently that I'm still going through) and now I only buy
books on the Kindle or through `O'Reilly <http://www.oreilly.com/>`_. I use
a Macbook Pro laptop instead of a desktop computer. Slowly but surely the 
shift from having lots of "stuff" to a more focused set of useful possessions 
is happening.

A burden is removed when you stop thinking about buying things and 
shift into a mindset of only keeping what you need. Combine that mindset with a 
redoubled focus on the people around you and the experiences you 
share together. This perspective shift may not be for everyone - materialism 
is still a big part of the American lifestyle. But reducing possessions and 
thinking more about those around you is worth a thought while we are in the 
shadow of the "Great Recession" and most people are already forced to cut back.
