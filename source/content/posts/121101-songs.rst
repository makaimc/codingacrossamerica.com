I came up with a list of 30 songs, one each for each of the 30 cities I will
be traveling to. Each of the songs has a different meaning - whether with 
the city itself, such as Johnny Cash from Memphis, TN, a song about the 
city, such as "Wide Awake" by Chris Cornell, or something personal to me.
Some of them are just personal favorite songs by artists who grew up or
got their start in that city.
