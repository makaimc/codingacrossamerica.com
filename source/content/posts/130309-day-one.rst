A detour on my drive down from Washington, DC to Charlottesville, Virginia.

----

Today I left Washington, DC to drive to Charlottesville, Virginia. The
drive is about two hours, Route 66 West to 29 South. I managed to fit all
my stuff in my car - barely. Those are my bags piled up on the passenger
seat. I'm getting rid of more of what I own so everything can fit in my 
trunk. Some of it I can pitch naturally; there are few clothes I know I
can get rid of as well as some random items to toss. Still, that trunk
is *small*.
