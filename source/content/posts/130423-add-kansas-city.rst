I'm officially adding Kansas City, Missouri to my destinations list.

A picture of downtown Kansas City I took while in town last summer.

I will be in KC from Tuesday, June 25 through Thursday, June 27 with the
option to add an extra day before or afterwards.

What's in Kansas City? 
----------------------
Quite a bit even without taking into consideration the 
excitement over the `Google Fiber <https://fiber.google.com/>`_ rollout.

I'll be meeting with Luke Norris 
(`@norrisluke <https://twitter.com/norrisluke>`_) and some of the 
Code for America fellows, the Kauffman Foundation, some local startups, 
co-working spaces, and incubators. More info to come as the dates get 
closer.
