Staying In Shape On The Road
============================

I work out almost every day and access to my gym in Arlington is convenient 
(a walk across the street). So figuring out how to stay in shape on the road
has been a particular challenge. I don't think I'll have it completely
figured out by the time I leave. It'll probably be something that evolves as
I travel from one city to another.

Here are some of my thoughts outlining the approach I'll take when I start
my trip.

1. Create a routine that can be done anywhere I'm staying, even if I do not have access to a gym
2. Rely primarily on bodyweight exercises
3. Bring two 25-pound dumbbells with me (not certain about this just yet)
