Is there a better model for building certain types of software products 
used by the federal government? With billions of dollars* in 
failed information technology projects over the last decade, there certainly 
seems to be room for improvement.

One of the issues with products built for government workers is that
commonly users who will actually work with the system do not control how 
money is spent. Managers who will not be using the system are wowed by 
great demos and flashy features. Yet many of those features are useless 
to the real users.

`HumanGeo <http://www.thehumangeo.com/>`_ 
(`@thehumangeo <https://twitter.com/thehumangeo>`_), 
based in Arlington, Virginia across the Potomac River from Washington, 
DC, appears to have a better model. Experts in military intelligence at 
HumanGeo work directly with their top notch software developers. Together 
they create elegant solutions to hard problems.

Developers are granted freedom to use powerful technologies such as: 

* `d3.js <http://d3js.org/>`_ for 
  `dynamic <http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/collision.html>`_ 
  `visualization <http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063570>`_ 
  `creation <http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html>`_

* `Leaflet <http://leafletjs.com/>`_ for cross-platform (both dekstop 
  and mobile), interactive maps

* `HBase <http://hbase.apache.org/>`_ for storing and accessing massive
  amounts of data that can be feed into algorithms to create actionable
  information

These free `open source <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_
software libraries are commonly used by start ups and organizations with
effective software development embedded in their culture. However, the above
technologies (among many others) are rarely used in government projects. 
Government employees and contractors are often hamstrung by a rigid set of 
pre-approved technologies that cannot solve problems in effective ways. 

**If the only tool available to you is a hammer, everything looks 
like a nail.**

The rigid toolset is indicative of larger organization dysfunction. When
the software development process does not work, well-meaning but 
non-technical supervisors add more procedures and checkpoints. The 
organization becomes content with failing in a structured way instead of
succeeding with a flexible approach to software development.

Change the Approach
-------------------
HumanGeo's approach to solving problems in the intelligence space breaks
down barriers between real system users and software developers. Feedback
is immediate and clear. Relationships and trust are built between the experts
who understand their fields and developers who understand a wide swath of
technologies. Once a product solves a problem, HumanGeo's well-respected 
intelligence analysts influence others in their community facing
that problem. HumanGeo sells their products and consulting services 
around effective solutions to real issues faced by users. 

HumanGeo's approach is not perfect, but it is a marked departure from 
how many large firms in the Washington, DC region operate. Traditionally,
large federal government consulting firms sell a "butts in seats" model. Get
contractors in the door and let them augment staff positions.
Developers have limited freedom and influence to change the status quo.
They are contracted to do as they are told even if that direction is a clear
path to failure.

Many of HumanGeo's developers came from other DC consulting firms who
follow the butts-in-seats model; some are my former coworkers. We saw 
first hand how we were shipped off to a government site and put in a seat. 
We railed against the inefficiencies from the inside without 
understanding the dynamic that it was in the best interest of our 
employer to maintain the failing status quo.

Developers at HumanGeo are constantly experimenting with new technologies
and sharing that knowledge among members of the team. They also reach out
to the greater community through technology meetups such as 
`Intel Analytics DC <http://www.meetup.com/Intel-Analytics-DC/>`_.


Government as a Platform
------------------------
I asked HumanGeo's developers about 
`Tim O'Reilly's ideas on government as a platform <../tim-oreilly-open-government.html>`_. They agreed having more raw data available through
APIs would help private industry create new applications for citizens.
In the military intelligence space there would need to be limits on 
access. Yet many principles of data sharing from citizen-facing agencies can 
make the
`security cleared <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance>`_ 
sector more effective as well.

An interesting idea emerged from our discussion: how do you get
large public datasets from the government onto platforms where innovative
applications can be created? Downloading large data sets can take hours or
days and then it often needs to be uploaded into another environment. Large
data transfers incur a bandwidth cost that is often prohibitively expensive.

One idea is for the government to partner with cloud services such as 
`Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_, 
`Red Hat OpenShift <https://openshift.redhat.com/app/>`_, and
`Rackspace Cloud <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/>`_ to offer lower cost 
access to public data on platforms that developers can immediately use to
do heavy data processing. With the data already on the platform data it would
not require immediate transfer to become useful. It's an idea worth further 
exploration.


What's Next?

On Tuesday I interviewed a development team from a Washington, DC company 
with a platform for making informed decisions about many aspects of personal
healthcare. My story about
`WiserTogether <http://www.wisertogether.com/>`_ comes next.
