ForwardMetrics is a San Diego-based startup about to launch its new strategic
planning web application, FM Navigator.

ForwardMetrics is located about thirty minutes of downtown San Diego in 
Encinitas, CA. The San Diego startup scene has loosely-affiliated networks 
developing in various locations in and around the city. ForwardMetrics is
an example of a startup outside the EvoNexus-centered downtown area.

Ozzie DiVinere and Scott Warner founded ForwardMetrics in 2011.

Ozzie and Scott saw a need for a flexible, easy-to-use strategic planning 
tool where non-technical users could simply drag-and-drop items to 
reorganize their plans. Their tool, called FM Navigator, 
will be coming out of beta and into public release within the next few days.

The team built a significant amount of custom code to create a uniform user 
experience across many devices. They found that existing drag-and-drop 
libraries could not provide a consistent experience across desktop browsers, 
tablets, and mobile devices. 

ForwardMetrics' development team, led by Scott, built a custom JavaScript 
library for the user interface. The library connects to a PHP backend on 
their servers. All items on the screen that are dragged and dropped are 
immediately synced with the servers and then between all browsers with the 
same plan open. If a user one browser and her colleague is working in 
another on the same plan, you can see each others' changes in real-time.

Another focus of the application is the metrics' visualization. Visualizing
plan projections and milestones is important to the tools' target market.

Another aspect of the software I found impressive during the demo Scott
gave me was the language translation. Language translation is one of those
nasty, time-consuming, big problems that's hard to get right. The market
for strategic planning tools needs language translation because there are
many international customers. 

FM Navigator handles this problem by translating an initial set of languages. 
Then as users work through the application in a different language, their 
users can vote on which translations are appropriate, essentially 
crowdsourcing the solutions. More information can be found about
ForwardMetrics' FM Navigator product on their 
`FAQ page <http://www.forwardmetrics.com/faq>`_.
