Here are a few "rear of the car"-perspective pictures from the first five 
days in Charlottesville. The first several pictures were taken during the
full days I had in Charlottesville when I found an interesting place to
pull over. The final picture was taken in Virginia on the way to Charlotte, 
North Carolina.

During my time in Charlottesville I met with Arin Sime of AgilityFeat and
a group from WillowTree Apps. Posts on each company, as well as my thoughts
on working in software development in Washington, DC versus Charlottesville 
coming soon.

Entrance to `Horton Vineyard <http://hortonwine.com/>`_ in Gordonsville, 
Virginia. Sadly I did not have time to stop and drink wine but I thought 
their buildings architecture was interesting.

on the program a few months after I finished.
