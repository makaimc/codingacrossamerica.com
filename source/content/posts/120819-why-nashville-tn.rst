Why Nashville, TN?
==================

I have never been to Nashville before, so image I have in my head of what it's
like is a gross generalization of what I am sure it actually is. I mainly
envision country music, a South/Midwestern sort of pride by the people that
reside there, and very little focus on new technology. I am probably wrong
about those three generalizations.

I was pleasantly surprised once I began looking into Nashville's venture 
capital and start up scene. Nashville intrigues me because no one thinks
about interesting tech and start ups coming out of there, but there seems
to be a lot of momentum behind organizations such as 
`Startup Tennessee <http://www.startuptn.com/>`_,
`Entrepreneur Center <http://entrepreneurcenter.com/>`_, and
`Colab <http://nashville.colabusa.com/>`_.

First Glance Start Up Scene
---------------------------
There's a bunch of interesting startups in various industries. Several 
examples: 

1. `Stratasan <http://www.stratasan.com/>`_. Healthcare data analytics. `Stratasan is using Python & Django <http://www.stratasan.com/jobs/>`_.

2. `Borderjump <http://www.borderjump.com/>`_. International payments and exports API. `Borderjump is using Python & Django <http://jobnashville.net/job/16870/lead-developer-platform-architect-nashville-tn-downtownsobro-at/>`_.

3. `Source Your City <http://www.sourceyourcity.com/>`_. Connects reporters and bloggers with specialty matter experts from various fields. Unclear what technology platform their service is built on.

There seem to be a cluster of companies in the health care technology space.
I need to do further research to find out why that is.

Late March Weather
------------------
I'm planning to arrive on March 17, so the weather will probably be high 50s
to low 60s. Borderline nice but not warm enough for shorts and flip flops.


More Research
-------------
I will be `posting my research notes <../nashville-tn.html>`_ as I continue to gather more information about Nashville, TN.
