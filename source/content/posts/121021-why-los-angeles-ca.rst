Why Los Angeles, CA?
====================

I have never been to Los Angeles before. The stories I hear about LA's 
massive traffic jams and major suburban sprawl remind me of Northern 
Virginia - only worse. A trip up the West Coast just wouldn't seem complete
though without a stop in LA. And it'll a comparison point for what I see
in San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle's start up scenes. 

Los Angeles is stop number twelve out of the thirty cities I am visiting.

Start Up Culture
----------------
I found the `Los Angeles Startups twitter account <https://twitter.com/LA_Startups>`_ really useful for learning about companies in the city. There are
many small companies here which is expected for a city with almost 13 million
people in the metro area. 

What I'll find interesting is whether being close to San Francisco helps 
or hurts entrepreneurship. On one hand, I'm sure
some people move back and forth between California cities which helps
spread ideas about technology and innovation. On the other hand, if you're
serious about starting a company, maybe people just up and move to San
Francisco / Palo Alto. Perhaps a third variable, such as the major 
prescence of the movie industry, impacts the startup landscape in a 
more dramatic way than proximity to other California cities. This situation
needs more research before I take off on the road.


More Research
-------------
I'll `post further notes <../los-angeles-ca.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about Los Angeles.
