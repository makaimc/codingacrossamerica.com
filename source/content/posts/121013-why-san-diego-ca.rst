Why San Diego, CA?
==================

San Diego was a late addition to my slate of destinations. I added San Diego
for a couple of reasons. First, I ran into an old friend in DC who was 
back in town visiting from San Diego. She loves living in San Diego, 
asked me "why not visit?" and I didn't have a good answer for why I 
wasn't going. So that got me started thinking about it. Second, my 
brother hung out in San Diego for a few days when he drove across the 
country and he said it was amazing.

Plus no trip up the West Coast would seem complete unless I went the almost
full length from San Diego to Seattle. San Diego is destination number
eleven during Coding Across America.

Start Up Culture
----------------
This is where my Coding Across America trip puts the focus back on technology,
meet ups, and start ups. San Diego has a pretty good tech scene. There's quite
a `bit of venture funding here <http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2012/07/20/san-diego-startups-raise-over-300m-from-vcs-in-second-quarter/>`_
and more start ups than I have time to talk with. This should be an exciting
location to visit.


More Research
-------------
I'll `post further notes <../san-diego-ca.html>`_ as I continue to gather 
more information about San Diego.
