The temperature is 25 degrees in Lubbock this morning. I didn't 
expect to wake up to snow in April.

The drive from Lubbock, TX to Los Alamos, NM.

----

I am only spending a couple of days in Los Alamos to catch up on work and
writing. There are still a lot of posts that need to be published before I
hit the West Coast.

Los Alamos is destination number eight of thirty for Coding Across America.

On Friday I'll head up to Moab, Utah for some off-roading 
and camping with my buddy
