The drive from Charlotte, NC to New Orleans, LA

----

New Orleans is destination number three of thirty for Coding Across America.

This will be the longest one-day drive of my trip at over twelve hours
straight on the road. At least I'll get it out of the way early in my
journey.

In New Orleans I will be working with MBA teams from around the country who
are helping local entrepreneurs on their early stage businesses. I'll also
report on what's going on with the NOLA entrepreneurship as part of New
Orleans Entrepreneurship Week put on by IdeaVillage.
