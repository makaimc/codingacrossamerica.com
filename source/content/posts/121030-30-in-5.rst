The schedule is now set. Thirty cities in just over five months (exactly 
five months and six days). March 9, 2013 to August 15, 2013.

The final city additions include Detroit, Buffalo (NY), and Boston while I 
cut Pittsburgh and Indianapolis since they took me too far south to visit
Boston.

I am currently finishing up my research on each city and planning
individual days when I will be programming, meeting up with people, and 
exploring each city. I won't have every day planned exactly - it's better
to leave some flexibility in case there are unexpected adventures along
the way.

More details to come soon now that it's about four months until the trip
begins.
