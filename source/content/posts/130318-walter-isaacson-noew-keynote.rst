New Orleans native `Walter Isaacson <https://twitter.com/WalterIsaacson>`_ 
gave a keynote speech this evening at the
`New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week (NOEW) <http://ideavillage.org/how_it_works/noew/>`_ 
keynote. Walter's talk focused on how diversity nutures entrepreneurship. He
provided historical context for the two distinct waves of entrepreneurial 
movements in New Orleans' since the city's founding in 1718. He then 
elaborated on how entrepreneurship is enabled by diversity and how New 
Orleans can use its diversity to "ride a new wave" of entrepreneurship-driven 
growth.

audience this afternoon at Gallier Hall in News Orleans, Louisiana.

Historical Context
------------------
Business driven by new technology defines New Orleans' history. 
In the early 1800s, Eli Whitney's cotton gin created great
fortunes for entrepreneurial city residents. During the 1830s and 1840s
New Orleans was the wealthiest city in the United States with the 
third largest population. Walter defined this era as the "first wave" of 
entrepreneurship.

The New Orleans Cotton Exchange, migration of Italians to the city, and the 
rise of literary culture during the late 1800s drove the second boom. The 
literary culture created a mythology around the city as a 
place to capture the imagination. Novel cuisines were created and the
modern cookbook was invented in the city. Writings of the era created 
visions of what New Orleans could become and defined ideas about the city's
exceptionalism. 


20th Century Decline
--------------------
The `Industrial & Cotton Centennial <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cotton_Centennial>`_
was the peak event of the second entrepreneurship era. The Centennial also 
represented the beginning of New Orleans' decline compared to where it had
been. Isaacson highlighted that the city's history during the 20th century 
was marked by segregation. Wealthier residents moved out to the suburbs and
the migration accelerated with the creation of the interstate highway system.

The core NOLA integrated diversity experience was disrupted by urban flight.
Segregation destroyed much of the unique diverse culture in the city.


The Third Wave Is Now
---------------------
The phrase both spoken and written across clothing during NOEW was 
"ride the third wave." After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 there was an 
outpouring of support volunteers and non-profits from across the United 
States.

Walter brought up a specific example from when he was running Teach for 
America. There were 250 Teach for America fellows in New Orleans when 
Hurricane Katrina hit. The public school system was devastated. Out of 250
fellows offered positions in other cities, 250 declined the offers. They 
instead stayed in New Orleans to help the rebuilding process.

That enduring spirit, as well as many of the original volunteers, remain in
New Orleans today. Isaacson warned though that a key piece of the third 
wave is to not only rebuild the education system but make it better in 
every way. 

Education is critical to the city's third entrepreneurial wave.
Fortunately, organizations such as `4.0 Schools <http://4pt0.org/>`_
are working to innovate in the education space.


Art and Engineering
-------------------
Isaacson told a story about when he talked to Steve Jobs during 
research for Jobs' biography. Steve said that engineering without art creates
cold, emotionless products. Only when engineering intersects with art can
beautiful products that enhance people's lives be created.
  
  "Creativity will never be automated." - Walter Issacson

Art is made from combining diverse influences. New Orleans' history and its
recent resurgence after Hurricane Katrina provides an opportunity for the
city to use its rich art scene with engineering.


Diversity Nutures Entrepreneurship
----------------------------------
When groups from diverse backgrounds come together to tackle a problem, each
person brings a different perspective for solutions. Diversity prevents 
groupthink and vets ideas from multiple angles.

New Orleans' diverse population groups, like its rich history of art, create
the potential for a culture where entrepreneurship is common. 
`IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_ and
`Launchpad New Orleans <http://lp.co/>`_ provide an initial foundation for
New Orleans to make the dream of the third wave a reality.
