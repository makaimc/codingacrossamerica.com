Hacker Houses Are An Underused Resource

I've constantly been asked during my Coding Across America project if I
know any software developers to hire from outside the area who would be
willing to relocate. The attracting talent problem is most acute in 
cities with smaller tech communities such as 
`Charlottesville, Virginia <../charlottesville-va.html>`_, 
`Eugene, Oregon <../eugene-or.html>`_, and
`Memphis, Tennessee <../memphis-tn.html>`_.

Hacker houses, such as 
`Chez JJ in San Francisco <https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/470096>`_ and
`Ben Barrethâ€™s Hacker House in Kansas City <http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/06/take-a-stroll-through-ben-barreth-s-hacker-house-in-kansas-city>`_ 
are an underused resource for attracting software developers to a city.
It's surprising that I have not seen groups of tech companies band together
to create hacker houses and market them to developers outside their
communities.

Here's an example. Let's say in Eugene, Oregon that 
`Concentric Sky <http://concentricsky.com/>`_,
`Palo Alto Software <http://www.paloalto.com/>`_, and other organizations
in the `Silicon Shire <http://siliconshire.org/>`_ bought a house close
to downtown. They then administer and market that house to software developers
outside the area. They create a quick website for it and put it on 
`Airbnb <http://www.airbnb.com/>`_. Developers both from outside the area
and those new to town can stay for $25 a night (whatever it takes to just
barely make a profit), walk to downtown, and get tours of the tech 
companies in town. 

I guarantee that software developers in Silicon Valley who are tired
of the 12 hour workdays at some startups would be interested in getting
out of town for a week. Some of those software developers will want to
leave the Valley for the Shire after spending time up in Eugene. Ditto for
Charlottesville, Memphis, New Orleans, and so on. Hacker houses, done right,
are a way to enable that type of talent transfer.
