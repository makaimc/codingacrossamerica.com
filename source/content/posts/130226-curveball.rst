Schedule Curveball
==================

My schedule is shifting slightly before I hit the road in less than two
weeks. I have an opportunity to observe and assist at 
`IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_'s 
`New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week <http://ideavillage.org/how_it_works/noew/>`_ (NOEW)
from March 16th through the 22nd. That is a week earlier than I planned to
be in New Orleans. I do not want to pass up this great opportunity to 
showcase what's going on in New Orleans.

To attend NOEW I am forced to drop Nashville. I will drive directly from 
Charlotte to New Orleans. After New Orleans I will backtrack north to 
Memphis for a few days. Then I will head through Dallas to Austin where 
the remainder of my schedule is the same. The dates on my 
`cities <../cities.html>`_ page have been updated with this schedule change.

So far I have booked my accomodations in 
`Charlottesville <../charlottesville-va.html>`_,
`Charlotte <../charlotte-nc.html>`_,
`New Orleans <../new-orleans-la.html>`_, `Memphis <../memphis-tn.html>`_,
`Las Vegas <../las-vegas-nv.html>`_, 
`Los Angeles <../los-angeles-ca.html>`_, and
`San Francisco <../san-francisco-ca.html>`_. 

Within the next few days I will book `Dallas <../dallas-tx.html>`_, 
`Austin <../austin-tx.html>`_, `Lubbock <../lubbock-tx.html>`_, 
`Los Alamos <../los-alamos-nm.html>`_, `Moab <../moab-ut.html>`_, 
`Flagstaff <../flagstaff-az.html>`_, and `San Diego <../san-diego-ca.html>`_.
I want to keep my schedule somewhat flexible after that period of time so I
will hold off on booking anything after San Francisco for at least a couple
of weeks.

My story on `WiserTogether <http://www.wisertogether.com/>`_ is up next.
