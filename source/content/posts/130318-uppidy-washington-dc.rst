92% of people in the United States use their phones to send text messages. 
We rely so heavily on text messaging that most of us take the service for
granted. Texting is just part of our daily lives.

But what would you do if you unexpectedly lost all of the text messages
on your phone? Could AT&T or Verizon retrieve that data at your request?

The answer, shockingly, is no. Your "personal" data is actually the 
property of your phone service provider. There is no way to retrieve the
data unless you have a court subpoena. Even with a subpoena the 
service provider will only grant you one week's history of your own 
personal records.

For most casual conversations the potential loss of data is not much of a
concern. But some situations are different. For example, what if one of 
the text message logs you lost were with a friend who died suddenly
after your conversation? There is no technical reason why keeping data 
for sentimental and nostalgic value is not possible.

There must be a better solution to this problem, especially as our 
communications increasingly become purely digital.

founder of `Uppidy <http://www.uppidy.com>`_ in Washington, DC, has a 
potential answer.

Uppidy in Washington, DC
------------------------
Uppidy is an app for Android, BlackBerry, and iOS phones that saves
your text messages to its service. A user can then search through and 
view text message archives. The Wall Street Journal 
`detailed how Uppidy and another app, Calltrunk <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304432704577349881132834906.html>`_ 
work early last year.


Discovering the Business Model
------------------------------
Uppidy is still discovering the right business model mix for its service.
It current uses in-app ads as one form of revenue.


Entrepreneurship in Washington, DC
----------------------------------
Josh and I had a wide ranging discussion not only about Uppidy as his most 
recent company (he started and sold two previous companies) but also about 
Washington, DC entrepreneurship in general. I will detail that part of our 
conversation in a future post.
