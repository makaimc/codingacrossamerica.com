This is a short post. I'm settling back into downtown Washington, D.C. now 
that I have been back for about a week and a half. 

I am extending an open invitation to software developers visiting D.C. who
want help getting connected to the tech scene here. If you are coming to
town for a conference or vacation and are interested in checking out the
software development community, please shoot me an email at 
matthew.makai@gmail.com.

I'm happy to make introductions as a way of paying it forward. It's the least
I can do after such warm welcomes by so many 
`people and organizations </thank-you.html>`_ I met with while on the road
and the widely generous software development community across the U.S.
