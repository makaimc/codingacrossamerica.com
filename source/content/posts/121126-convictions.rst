**"Some convictions are so strong that the world must break to 
accommodate them."**

I strongly hold two convictions:

1. Software development is awesome - if you're stressed out and not 
   delivering amazing new work to end users every day, you're doing it wrong

2. More young people need to be inspired to go into software development
   by *showing* them how amazing the work is

And that's a huge part of what my trip is about. Software development isn't
about geeks sitting behind monitors in a dark room all day. It's not about
people that can't socialize with others so they are relegated to a corner
with a computer. It's not about `brogrammers <http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/07/tech/web/brogrammers/index.html>`_ (don't even get me started on that
shit).

Software development is about solving problems using technology. You
can only solve problems that truly matter if you talk to people 
*with problems*. And that's part of why I'm traveling across the United States
for 5 months - to prove that software development is more than just the
stereotypical geek sitting behind a computer every minute of the day.

If more people are inspired to do great work in technology then this
trip will be worth it for more than just myself and the world will be better
off for it.
