I spent three nights in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 28 until May 1st
between stops in San Diego and Los Angeles. These are some pictures from the 
Vegas Strip, downtown, and a view of the city from Downtown Project.

Much of my time in Vegas was spent at the amazing
`Microconf 2013 </microconf-2013-las-vegas.html>`_ conference.
I also checked out the `Downtown Project <http://downtownproject.com/>`_ 
and met a couple of fun girls from (where else other than) Austin, Texas, 
Carolina (`@Carol91186 <https://twitter.com/Carol91186>`_) 
and Tabitha (`@TabithaFierro <https://twitter.com/TabithaFierro>`_) 
during the tour.
