I spent three nights in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 28 until May 1st. Most
of my time was spent at `Microconf 2013 </microconf-2013-las-vegas.html>`_.
I also checked out the `Downtown Project <http://downtownproject.com/>`_ 
and met a couple of fun girls from (where else other than) Austin, Texas, 
Carolina (`@Carol91186 <https://twitter.com/Carol91186>`_) 
and Tabitha (`@TabithaFierro <https://twitter.com/TabithaFierro>`_) 
during the tour.
