Yes, I know I have been putting up posts a lot slower than I did earlier in 
my trip. I have actually had a lot of great meetings lately in San Francisco. 
There is a whole bunch of great new content which I have to finish up and 
publish.

I'm working on a site redesign that will define what the finished output
of my five month project will ultimately be. It's taking me awhile because
I have several new visualizations (in `d3.js <http://d3js.org/>`_) which I'm
working on. I'll have it wrapped up in the next few days and get it live.
