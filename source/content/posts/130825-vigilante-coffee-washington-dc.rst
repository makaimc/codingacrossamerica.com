The place feels similar
to coffee shops in the Pacific Northwest, which is difficult to find
anywhere in Washington, D.C. The inside is sparce but there
are plenty of tables to work at. The coffee is made one cup at a time in
pour over fashion and there are several rotating beans to choose from.

I found Vigilante Coffee to be a good spot for coding. The music isn't too 
loud so you can put your headphones on and not be distracted by anything 
going on around you. There are only a few easily accessible electric 
outlets depending on where you sit. However, the cafe is dark enough that 
you can have your screen brightness low to conserve battery power.

I was able to jump on a password-less wifi connection easily enough while
there. Next time I stop by I'll make sure that's actually their Internet
though.
