How do people facing life altering health care decisions make the right 
choices for their treatment? People turn to family, friends, and the web 
to obtain advice outside of the doctor's office. However, information 
available for their situations is often not actionable. 

In 2007, Shub Debgupta and his wife faced a difficult health decision 
during the pregancy of their first child. There was a possibility their 
child could be born with significant learning difficulties. Shub and his
wife asked themselves questions they could not find answers to, including:

* How did other people handle their situation?

* What would doctors, themselves faced with such a situation, choice to do?

* How could you compare various factors that influence your decision?


Shub and his wife were fortunate. Their child was born healthy, without the 
complications they feared. Yet the difficult experience stuck with Shub. In 
early 2008, he founded `WiserTogether <http://www.wisertogether.com/>`_.

Shub's vision led to a process for people making health care choices
to first learn, then compare, connect, and ultimately decide on the right
action for their situation. 

The resulting platform for this process is a 
software decision support platform called 
`WiserHealth <https://mywiserhealth.com/>`_ 
for people facing difficult health situations. WiserHealth
provides analysis based on data collected from real patients previously
in those situations.

Government as a Platform
------------------------
How can federal and state governments help health care companies like
WiserTogether? Part of our discussion centered on 
`HIPAA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act>`_.

What's Next?

If you enjoyed WiserTogether's story, you may also enjoy reading about
`HumanGeo's approach to product development <../human-geo-washington-dc.html>`_
for geospatial mapping software in the cleared intelligence space.

On March 9, I will head out to Charlottesville, Virginia and begin my tour
of 30 cities across the United States. I may meet with and write about one 
or two more companies in DC before heading out if I can fit it into next
week's schedule.
