The drive from Washington, DC to Charlottesville, VA

----

Charlottesville is the first destination of thirty cities for my trip around
the country to meet with people solving interesting problems with software.

In Charlottesville I will be meeting with AgilityFeat and WillowTree Apps,
catching up with my former development team from when I worked here for a
couple of years, and making sure that I'm ready to go through with the next
five months.
