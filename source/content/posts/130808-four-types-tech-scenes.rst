After traveling to 30 cities over the past 5 months as part of my 
`Coding Across America </#intro>`_ project, I've discovered that entrepreneurs
can categorize cities into one of four types of software development scenes.

Software developers with a full stack skill set are necessary as a 
"raw input" to an entrepreneurial culture. Over time, a startup scene without 
access to software developers will wither and die as the entrepreneurs 
move to cities with better tech scenes.

Type 1: Severely Limited Tech Community
---------------------------------------
Entrepreneurs in some cities find themselves with severely limited 
access to software development talent of any type. To build and scale a 
business with software as a major component (which most businesses today need 
for differentiation), the business will likely have to move or open another
office in a different city.

For example, from my trip I found this issue to be the case in 
`New Orleans </new-orleans-la.html>`_. NOLA has a thriving entrepreneurial
community with `IdeaVillage <http://ideavillage.org/>`_, 
`4.0 Schools <http://4pt0.org/>`_, and events such as 
`New Orleans Entrepreneurship Week <http://ideavillage.org/how_it_works/noew/>`_. 
However, the raw input pool of software developers is simply not large enough
to sustain an entrepreneurial community. I'm not trying to take away from
the software developers who are there - certain events like 
`NOLA Hack Night <http://www.meetup.com/nolahacknight/>`_ show that there 
*are* developers. However, there are simply not enough of them given the
size of New Orleans.

Cities with a severely limited tech community should first incentivize 
companies to hire software developers for local positions. In addition,
local leadership who run tech meetups are key to building a strongly bound
tech community. Once a small community is established, tech startups should
consider banding together to create 
`hacker houses </hacker-houses-underused-resource.html>`_.


Type 2: Primarily Enterprise Development
----------------------------------------
The second type of city has software development talent, although the talent 
is geared towards narrowly scoped enterprise software skills, such as SOAP
web services. A developer can stay in a position for years generating XML
schemas for web services and not learn any other parts of a technology stack!
That type of developer would struggle mightily in a startup environment where
developers share responsibilities for all parts of the product until the
team scales to a sufficiently large size.

Non-technical entrepreneurs with a fledgling business are looking for 
"full stack" developers who can build an entire product from the back 
end database creation to the front end CSS design, as well as run the 
application (or mobile app) in production.

Another challenge in these cities is that the culture often 
discourages leaving an established job to take a risk at a startup. If a
startup fails, large enterprises are often reluctant to hire workers back
due to the mistaken view that time at a startup is similar to being unemployed.

Examples of this type of city are `Memphis, TN </memphis-tn.html>`_, 
`Charlotte, NC </charlotte-nc.html>`_, `Dallas, TX </dallas-tx.html>`_, and
`Omaha, NE </omaha-ne.html>`_. Note however, Washington, DC is not included
in this category even though it shares many characteristics (DC falls in
type 3, next).

Entreprise development type cities have a huge potential source for great
developers: pick out the best developers who are bored in their jobs and
have a passion for learning more. Hooking those developers into local tech
meetups with entrepreneurs and full stack developers provides an opportunity
to over time get them the broad skill set they'd need to succeed at a tech
startup.

Type 3: Consulting Skewed
-------------------------
As I traveled and talked with tech startups and software developers
around the country I realized Washington, DC is an oddity in this list.
That's either a good or a bad thing depending on whether you think what
matters is entrepreneurship, or 
`startups meant for rapid growth <http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html>`_.

Entrepreneurship is common in Washington, DC. But the easiest business to
start is a consulting firm. Think of the advantages: hire when someone else
is willing to pay for that person's salary (plus extra), minimal office 
overhead since most consultants are on client site, and downsize headcount
if necessary when projects end. Yet these same forces that make it easy to
start a consulting business also push up the salaries to a point where 
jumping to a scalable product-based startup creates too much risk versus
reward from a individual's financial standpoint.

Sure, some developers are attracted by the startup environment, a laid
back atmosphere, and the trendiness of working at a tech startup. But if 
you're a great developer who's into that, why wouldn't you just move to 
Austin, Texas? Without any other limiting factors, it would be silly
to deal with the high cost of living in D.C. and work at a tech startup.

I'm still on the fence as to whether Washington, D.C. can or should change
the consulting firm culture. I'll have more to say on this after I meet with
more members of the tech startup scene now that I have returned from
my trip.


Type 4: Extensive Talent, Massive Demand
----------------------------------------
The final type of scene I found in the United States was where there was
extensive talent throughout the city. However, massive demand by both startups
and large established tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook 
creates significant upward salary pressure.

Examples of these cities are `San Francisco </san-francisco-ca.html>`_ (and
the whole Bay Area), `Seattle </seattle-wa.html>`_, 
`Austin </austin-tx.html>`_, and to a lesser extent, 
`New York City </new-york-ny.html>`_.

Extensive talent, massive demand type of cities need ways to train new 
technical talent. A great
example is `The Starter League <http://www.starterleague.com/>`_ in Chicago.
Programs like The Starter League take people who have little to no 
programming ability and in several weeks getting them over the steep 
initial learning curve. Over time these types of programs create an influx
of tech workers with practical full stack skills. One area for improvement
will be engaging program alumni to make sure they are continuing to build 
their skills after they graduate.

Those are the four broad categories I found. I'm sure some aspects will 
change as I have time to reflect and discuss this subject further with 
various tech communities. For example, I did not address the tech
communities found in university-centered cities such as 
`Charlottesville </charlottesville-va.html>`_, 
`Boulder </boulder-co.html>`_, 
`Eugene </eugene-or.html>`_, and
`Madison </madison-wi.html>`_. If you find the subject interesting or have a 
comment about it, send me an email at matthew.makai@gmail.com.

If you found my writing in this post interesting you should also read about 
my perspectives on 
`hacker houses as an underutilized resource </hacker-houses-underused-resource.html>`_ 
and my post on why `doers help doers </starting-sustaining-book.html>`_.
