In 2012, Seed Spot accepted sixteen organizations for its inaugural 
`Venture Program class <http://seedspot.org/ventures/>`_ from a pool of
191 applications. The overwhelming number of applications for an as-unproven 
incubator program shows the demand by early stage ventures in Phoenix 
for initial structure and direction for their organizations.

Seed Spot's office is located in Phoenix, Arizona.

Seed Spot currently has a temporary space while building out a larger office
in the same building. The new space will allow a larger number of resident 
startups to work in the same location as well as engage with the greater
Phoenix community by hosting events.

In the meantime, the current office worked very well for hosting the 
`Startup America Regional Summit reception <http://www.s.co/blog/fifth-startup-america-summit>`_ 
on Monday night. Plus the view from the balcony is amazing as these pictures
show.

Social Innovation in Phoenix, Arizona
-------------------------------------

Seed Spot was founded by
`Courtney Klein Johnson <http://seedspot.org/our-team/courtney-klein-johnson/>`_ 
and `Chris Petroff <http://seedspot.org/our-team/chris-petroff/>`_. Courtney
and Chris' vision is to build a working space, incubator, and venture fund 
that supports a growing local community of positive social organizations. 

They look for both for-profit and nonprofit startups that can first apply
their methods locally, then scale nationally.
