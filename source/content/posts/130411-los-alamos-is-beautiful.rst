I am spending a few days in Los Alamos, New Mexico and then Moab, Utah 
to catch my breath. It's beautiful here. Here are some photos I took during
my drive up from Lubbock, Texas and while walking around town in Los Alamos.

winding road being an embodiment of my five month journey.

The landscape shifts from completely flat in the Texas Panhandle to starting
to have some hills. A little difficult to see in this shot.

...shifted suddenly into an eerie, ominous day. I thought I was going to find
out if the S2000 still had the chops to outrun a tornado.

The terrain became noticeably different while in New Mexico. Flat land gave
way to hills and mountainous areas in the distance.

Good thing it wasn't icy on the way up or I might not be around to snap
these shots.

If you live around the Rocky Mountains, I hope you never get tired of this
view or take it for granted. Amazing.
