I am spending a few days in Los Alamos, New Mexico and then Moab, Utah 
to catch my breath. It's beautiful here. Here are some photos I took during
my drive up from Lubbock, Texas and while walking around town in Los Alamos.

winding road being an embodiment of my five month journey.

  :alt: Landscape shifts from flat to hilly.

The landscape shifts from completely flat in the Texas Panhandle to starting
to have some hills. A little difficult to see in this shot.

...shifted suddenly into an eerie, ominous day. I thought I was going to find
out if the S2000 still had the chops to outrun a tornado.

  :alt: The terrain became more varied here.

The terrain became noticeably different while in New Mexico. Flat land gave
way to hills and mountainous areas in the distance.

After a little further on the drive the weather became beautiful again.

Not pictured: steep drop into oblivion.

Good thing it wasn't icy on the way up or I might not be around to snap
these shots.

If you live around the Rocky Mountains, I hope you never get tired of this
view or take it for granted. Amazing.
