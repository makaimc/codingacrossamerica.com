I've been on the road for two months today. Here are a few of my thoughts to 
date. 

At the one month mark I `wrote my thoughts <../month-meeting-startups.html>`_
on meeting startups. I still agree with what I wrote in that post. This post 
is a little different - more ad hoc topics in each section. Some of these
topics I've been thinking about for awhile. Others I've just realized in
the past day.

Home Run Skepticism
-------------------
Mainstream media primarily covers "home run hit" startups such as Facebook, 
Google, and Tesla. The media focus on the home runs obscures that there are
a huge number of self-funded companies creating value for their customers. 

Companies that are not venture capital backed can be less risky because they
are not trying to generate outsized returns for their investors. To keep with
the baseball analogy, a bunch of singles and doubles are great. It's 
important to *not* take venture capital if you want to build a company that 
provides you and your employees with good incomes and sustainable lifestyles.

Here are a dozen examples of such companies:

1. `Bidsketch <http://www.bidsketch.com/>`_
2. `HitTail <http://www.hittail.com/>`_
3. `Barefoot Solutions <http://www.barefootsolutions.com/>`_
4. `ConvertKit <http://convertkit.com/>`_
5. `Audit Shark <http://www.auditshark.com/>`_
6. `37Signals <http://www.37signals.com/>`_
7. `Smart Bear <http://smartbear.com/>`_
8. `Appointment Reminder <https://www.appointmentreminder.org/>`_
9. `CrazyEgg <http://www.crazyegg.com/>`_
10. `mGroomer <http://www.mgroomer.com/>`_
11. `WooThemes <http://www.woothemes.com/>`_
12. `QuickReader <http://www.quickreader.net/>`_


DC Won't Be A Startup Hub, But...
---------------------------------
I don't think DC is a good place to
build a startup. I am using Paul Graham's definition of startup as 
"`a company design to grow fast <http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html>`_".
But it *is* a hotbed of entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurs in DC start consulting companies. There's low overhead when
your consultants on on-site, hiring is driven by clients' willingness to 
bring another person on-board, and it's a tried and true model that DC
people understand.

When you create a startup you need to fight against the high salaries that
consulting firms offer, the lack of decent, cheap space downtown, and
the fact that people interested in startups move away from DC to places like
San Francisco, Seattle, and Austin.

I'll need to elaborate futher on this topic later. 


Our Education System is Fucked Up
---------------------------------
This isn't an original idea. It's amazing to me how our education system
prepares us for the 20th century. We're churning out students like we churn
out widgets in a factory. 

Yet the jobs in the 21st century requiring 
creativity and skills such as software development. We don't teach that.
Instead we have a glorified prison system where students are held hostage
for the formative years of their lives. And we have a massive bureaucratic
system preventing any sort of positive change. We're all to blame for this
incredible failing in our society. It's sad. We're failing the next 
generation even though everyone wants to talk endless how much we supposedly
care about our children.


This Website Design Sucks
-------------------------
I'm going to change the design. The blog format is stale and I have plenty 
of ideas for making it good now that I have some decent content.
