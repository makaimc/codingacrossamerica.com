---------------------------------------------------
PJ recommended I keep some days on my schedule completely clear of plans
so I could use those days to rest, relax, and do things spur-of-the-moment.

PJ is currently 
`kayaking down the Hudson River <http://instagr.am/p/LDa8U1C7Au/>`_ and taking
some time off this summer before starting the MBA program at Dartmouth in
August 2012.
