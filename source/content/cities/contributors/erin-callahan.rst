-----------------------------------------------

Erin recommended I visit her
`Uncle's bar O'Callaghan's <http://www.ocallaghanspub.com/>`_. 
She also suggested a bunch of great things to do while in Chicago.

Erin spent thirteen weeks in Ghana teaching children and helping the
local community. She 
`blogged about her experience <http://ecallahan.tumblr.com/>`_ while over
there.
