<h1>Breadth Versus Depth</h1>

      <p>One of the things I constantly struggle with in my software development
consulting career is balancing breadth versus depth.</p>
<p>When I graduated from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jmu.edu/">JMU</a> in 2005, I was
not deep in anything related to my career. I had a very broad knowledge
of computer science, Java programming, and a few pointers for where I
should look next to learn more. I started working in an enterprise
environment developing software (a really disfunctional environment - but
that's another story) at Freddie Mac. I expanded my breadth in learning
about version control systems, configuration management, handling myself
on a team of developers, and many other real world software development
topics. I became deeper in my knowledge of Java and the Java Virtual
Machine stack.</p>
<p>At the same time, I deepened my knowledge of computer science while taking
classes at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> to earn my Master's degree.
I dove deep into the relatively obscure realm of genetic algorithms and
their application to software testing.</p>
<p>Throughout my seven year career to date, I've bounced back and forth between
depth and breadth. I made a conscious decision to focus on Python development
once I picked it up in 2007 and ran with it. The tradeoff was a regression
in my depth in the JVM stack (although I still find
<a class="reference external" href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> very interesting) for a depth in the
Python ecosystem.</p>

<p>This relates to Coding Across America in a direct way because I do struggle
with how long to spend in each city. Certainly if I spent all four months
in Austin, TX, I'd learn a lot about the city, the people who live there,
the local spots to check out, and the technology scene there. I could
inundate myself in Austin's culture. But that wouldn't serve the goal I'm
trying to achieve on my trip.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago when I spent six solid days in Austin, it felt like a
good amount of time to get to know the area. However, I had already been
to Austin for long weekends a couple of times. On the other hand, I did not
exhaustively research where to go in Austin before my trip. So I'm hoping
a combination of research and discussing with people who've lived in cities
before is enough to get me over the learning curve of understanding a
location so that 5-10 days in most cities is enough.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's erring on the side of breadth, but that's the goal. This
isn't a trip about Coding Across Memphis, TN. It's about the United States
as a whole. Better to have more destinations with shorter stints in cities
both large and small rather than a few longer stays in cities that may
skew the results towards a vision that isn't accurate (say, Palo Alto,
Seattle, Austin, and Boulder for instance).</p>
